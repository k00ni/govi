"ALLOT","https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot","Akoma Ntoso (https://w3id.org/akn) is an open XML standard for parliamentary, legislative and judiciary documents. The Akoma Ntoso specifications, instead of forcing document authors to stick to one particular ontology, specify a very broad set of general guidelines that an ontology should conform to in order to be used in conjunction with Akoma Ntoso documents. These informal guidelines are mentioned with the name of *non-ontology*, and are implicitly referred by with specific XML tags (prefixed by TLC or FRBR ) in Akoma Ntoso documents, each referring to a particular (an informal) top level class (TLC).ALLOT (A Light Legal Ontology On TLCs) implements the Akoma Ntoso TLCs as a formal OWL 2 DL ontology, so as to model the entities that are present in legal documents (i.e., people, events, roles, etc.) with the main purpose of linking together datasets based, potentially, on different ontologies. ALLOT formalises the Akoma Ntoso TLCs in a set of OWL classes.## Top level classes in Akoma NtosoThe informal ontological structure defined by Akoma Ntoso for representing metadata is grounded in a basic set of concepts called top level classes (TLCs). The word informally is used because, on purpose, there is no mandated, exhaustive and shared ontology that defines these classes and the relations among them in Akoma Ntoso. What exists is a guideline that allows users (especially producers) of Akoma Ntoso documents to develop their own ontology according to their particular needs or to adopt one of the already existing ontologies, as long as it is compatible with the principles behind the TLC. These top level classes do not have a formal definition, they only have a broad description, useful to identify in very general terms what is their purpose and how one TLC differs from another.All this informality is needed to allow a great degree of flexibility in what can be expressed in the metadata layer of Akoma Ntoso documents, in order to adapt any legal document to many different ontological representation of concepts. It is the duty of a third party (e.g. the document creator or the document users) to associate a clear and formal semantics to each class using a specific formalism (e.g. OWL). This semantical detachment is an important feature that allows Akoma Ntoso to maintain documents understandable and consumable independently from the passing of time: future toolmakers will have clues about the intended meaning of a marker even in the unfortunate case the formal ontology is no longer available.## What is ALLOTALLOT is a proof-of-concept ontology we developed following the Akoma Ntoso non-ontology, its associated guidelines and best practices. ALLOT is available at https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot, while all the material related with the ontology is available on the ALLOT GitHub repository at https://github.com/essepuntato/allot. The current version of ALLOT is actually based on a previous implementation named ALLOT Core and available at http://akn.web.cs.unibo.it/allot/core.owl. The ALLOT ontology is meant to be used to describe in detail the documental and non-documental references (i.e. any entity) present in Akoma Ntoso documents. ALLOT can also be used to bridge knowledge bases extracted from Akoma Ntoso documents to knowledge bases that use other ontologies such as Metalex (http://justinian.leibnizcenter.org/MetaLex/metalex-cen.owl).In order to be reusable in different contexts, ALLOT has been aligned to two foundational ontologies, i.e. DOLCE and BFO. The alignment is still under revision and can slightly change in future releases of the ontology.One of the peculiarities of Akoma Ntoso (https://w3id.org/akn) is the idea of non-ontology: the use of few XML tags (prefixed with either TLC of FRBR ) that would refer some how to top level classes (TLCs) defined in an ontology for describing entities referenced in legal documents. ALLOT (A Light Legal Ontology on TLCs) provides a formal implementation of such TLCs in OWL 2 DL, with the intent of making available a vocabulary for enabling the integration of heterogeneous legal knowledge-bases.","","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fakn%2Fontology%2Fallot&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fakn%2Fontology%2Fallot&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fakn%2Fontology%2Fallot&f=ttl","2020-05-07","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

"AMV:Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary","https://w3id.org/amv","AMV v1.0 was first published on June 16, 2021. This is the revised version dated on February 6, 2023. Metadata vocabularies are used in various domains of study. It provides an in-depth description of the resources. In this work, we develop Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary (AMV), a vocabulary for capturing and storing the metadata about the algorithms (a procedure or a set of rules that is followed step-by-step to solve a problem, especially by a computer). The snag faced by the researchers in the current time is the failure of getting relevant results when searching for algorithms in any search engine. AMV is represented as a semantic model and produced OWL file, which can be directly used by anyone interested to create and publish algorithm metadata as a knowledge graph, or to provide metadata service through SPARQL endpoint. To design the vocabulary, we propose a well-defined methodology, which considers real issues faced by the algorithm users and the practitioners. The evaluation shows a promising result.","","","CC0 1.0 DEED","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/amv/versions/2023-02-06.n3","","","","2023-02-06","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"ASGS Ontology - ABS Structures and non-ABS structures","http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs","Ontology for the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), a framework of statistical areas used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and other organisations to enable the publication of statistics that are comparable and spatially integrated. This ontology contains the definitions for the ABS Structures which are areas that the ABS designs specifically for outputting statistics.ABS structures: - Mesh Block, Statistical Areas (Level 1 to Level 4), Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, State or Territory, Country classes- Indigenous location, Indigenous area, Indigenous region - Urban Centre and Locality, Section of State Range, Section of State, Significant Urban AreaNon ABS Structures which are not defined or maintained by the ABS but represent administrative areas for which the ABS is committed to providing a range of statistics. The classes defined here corresponds to ABS approximations of spatial areas or regions which are defined elsewhere- Local Government Areas (LGAs)- Postal Areas (POAs)- State Suburbs (SSCs)- Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CEDs)- State Electoral Divisions (SEDs)- Australian Drainage Divisions (ADDs)- Natural Resource Management Regions (NRMRs)- Tourism Regions (TRs)The ASGS uses Mesh Blocks as a common building block for all structures. Mesh Blocks are small enough that they can accurately approximate the changing administrative areas maintained by other organisations, without changing themselves.The publication of the ASGS ontology is part of the Australian Bureau of Statistics contribution to a joint effort to publish authoritative, interconnected spatial products (Location Index project).The ASGS Ontology is packaged in multiple graphs:- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs (this graph) contains the core classes for ASGS statistical units, and a small number of properties relating to their identity, classification, and containment hierarchy- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-cat contains the meshblock classification scheme- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-id contains specialised string types for identifiers and labels- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-path contains association classes and properties relating to paths between instances of the core classes- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-isof (deprecated) contains specialized predicates for containment relationships - this functionality is provided by generic within and isComposedOf relations instead- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-code (deprecated) contains specialised annotation properties for identifiers and labels - this functionality has been superseded by a set of data-types to be used in conjunction with more generic properties- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-prop (deprecated) contains specialised ASGS properties for relationships, classifiers, identifiers and labels - this functionality has been superseded by use of types from standardized RDF vocabularies","","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Flinked.data.gov.au%2Fdef%2Fasgs&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Flinked.data.gov.au%2Fdef%2Fasgs&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Flinked.data.gov.au%2Fdef%2Fasgs&f=ttl","2021-06-25","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

"AffectedBy ODP","https://w3id.org/affectedBy","The AffectedBy ODP consists of two classes aff:FeatureOfInterest and aff:Quality; and three properties aff:influencedBy, aff:belongsTo, and aff:affectedBy. This ODP is a reengineering of the SEAS Feature of Interest ontology (https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology-1.0). The constraint on the property seas:derivesFrom to be symmetric is unnecessary and sometimes innapropriate. For instance, the temperature of a room may derive from the occupancy of the room; however, it is not necessary that the occupancy derives from the temperature of the room. A new property aff:affectedBy (released from the symmetric constraint) is defined in the AffectedBy ODP to replace the role of the property seas:derivesFrom. It can be asserted that seas:derivesFrom is sub property of aff:affectedBy. The class aff:FeatureOfInterest is equivalent to seas:FeatureOfInterest, and the class seas:Property is sub class of aff:Quality. Moreover, seas:hasProperty is sub property of aff:influencedBy, and seas:isPropertyOf is sub property of aff:belongsTo. Furthermore, aff:belongsTo is defined to be functional, to support the notion that a quality is intrinsic to the feature of interest (i.e., an entity) to which it belongs (according to the conceptualization in DUL); and it is asserted that every quality belongs to a feature of interest (aff:Quality rdfs:subClassOf aff:belongsTo some aff:FeatureOfInterest). Finally, the object chain axiom aff:influencedBy o aff:affectedBy rdfs:subPropertyOf aff:influencedBy is asserted.","Iker Esnaola-Gonzalez Jesús Bermúdez","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=https://w3id.org/affectedBy","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2FaffectedBy&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2FaffectedBy&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2FaffectedBy&f=ttl","2018-11-28","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

This vocabulary defines the event framework and supplies a set of core event types that cover many use cases, but it is expected that it will be extended in other vocabularies to suit their needs. The intention of this vocabulary is to describe biographical events of people and this intention carries through to the definitions of the properties and classes which are person-centric rather than neutral. For example the Employment event puts the person being employed as the principal agent in the event rather than the employer. The BIO vocabulary defines a number of core classes and properties for describing biographical information: Figure: Biography Vocabulary Core Classes (PNG version, SVG version) At its heart the BIO vocabulary is concerned with people, their relationships and the events in their lives. Together these can be used to build up a narrative of a person s life and their interactions with other people, organizations and the world around them. Events bound intervals of time that may be associated with particular relationships between people and groups or organisations. Many different types of life event are defined in this vocabulary including the obvious Birth, Marriage and Death but also Coronation, Performance and even Murder. These events are not intended to be fully comprehensive but are representative of the types of events associated with biographical material. Currently the relationship segment of the vocabulary is underspecified with only a generic Relationship class available. It is envisaged that many types of relationship such as families, employments and ownerships will be specified in the future. The sequence of events and intervals build a timeline of history against which people and their relationships can be placed. The aim is to enable simple forms of genealogical reasoning such as determining whether a child was born out of wedlock or the location of a family given the fact one of their children was attending a particular school. Events are ordered in time by relating them to one another and to abstract intervals of time: Figure: Biography Vocabulary Timelines(PNG version, SVG version) Please see https://github.com/iand/vocab-bio for the master version of this vocabulary.","David Galbraith","","","http://vocab.org/bio/0.1/.html","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/bio/versions/2011-06-14.n3","","","","2011-06-14","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Brain Computing Interface (BCI) Ontology","https://w3id.org/BCI-ontology","The BCI ontology provides a high level semantic structure specialized metadata vocabulary set for real-world multimodal BCI data capture activities. The ontology defines a minimalist and simple abstract metadata foundational model for real-world BCI applications that monitors human activity in any scenario. BCI multimodal domain applications are encouraged to extend and use this ontology in their implementations.This ontology was developed following W3C Semantic Web ontology standards and guidelines, so that BCI applications can express reusable, interoperable and extendable machine-readable BCI metadata models, especially in pervasive M2M environments. For this purpose, its design was aligned to the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN), following closely its Stimulus-Sensor-Observation Ontology Design Pattern.The core and generic set of relevant metadata definitions for real-world BCI activities depicted on this ontology, were taken from different proposed vocabularies and formats in the BCI domain, such as: XDF, ESS and HED.The BCI ontology concepts are logically grouped in 10 modules. Each module represents a central topic of the ontology structure where the related concepts give a consistent explanation about its functional data model. The modules are:Subject: concepts related to the depiction of a human being (or human subject) engaging in an activity and its associate state.Context: captures the architectural description of an environment (or context). A human being interacts with a context.Session: represents the interaction between a subject and a context while performing a single activity, under specific settings and conditions.SSN-Skeleton: specific related concepts for BCI activities aligned to the Skeleton of SSN. Metadata related to records, modality types (such as EEG), channeling information, output streams (file formats and access) and stimulus events, are found in this module.SSN-Device: specific related concepts for BCI activities aligned to the Device module of SSN. Metadata related to devices and their channeling specification are found in this module.SSN-MeasurementCapability: specific related concepts for BCI activities aligned to the Measurement Capability module of SSN. Metadata related to channels and other measurement properties are found in this module.SSN-Data: specific related concepts for BCI activities aligned to the Data module of SSN. Metadata related to data blocks are defined in this module.AnnotationTag: relevant metadata about event markers (based on context stimuli) and response markers (based on machine learning models) for annotations on specific data segments (data tagging).Descriptor: a descriptor represent an external resource set that extends the description of entities in the ontology. A descriptor complements the information associated to the relevant metadata set, defined in this ontology.EEG: specific concepts for EEG (Electroencephalography) applications.This ontology describes the framework of core concepts to capture the specialized metadata vocabulary set for multimodal Brain Computing Interface (BCI) data capture activities.This ontology is developed by the Pervasive Embedded Technologies Laboratory (PET Lab) at the Computer Science Department of the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan (Republic of China, R.O.C). The concepts and structure of the ontology depict a foundational metadata model for BCI data capture activities, that BCI applications can extend and use in their implementations.Any feedback is welcome.

"Building Performance Ontology","https://w3id.org/bop#","The Building Performance Ontology (BOP) aims to enable the integration of topological building information with static and dynamic properties, to create a homogeneous data environment used by complex building performance assessments. It helps building managers and their software to deal with the large heterogeneity of information. While the data describing static and dynamic properties is fundamentally different, they share a similar context with a complex spatio-temporal resolution. The goal of this ontology is to represent this complex contextual information similarly for different types of information, which will increase the opportunities for using the linked data in complex equations and improves machine-readability. We tried to be as semantically correct as possible, while also aiming for simple and intuitive queries. By (re-)using concepts from major ontologies in the field, BOP could easily be integrated with a wide range of existing ontologies and datasets.","","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=https://w3id.org/bop#","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fbop%23&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fbop%23&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fbop%23&f=ttl","2021-10-16","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

"Building Product Ontology","https://w3id.org/bpo","The Building Product Ontology defines concepts to describe (building) products in a schematic way. It provides methods to describe assembly structures and attach properties to any component without restricting their types, as is often the case in template-driven product descriptions. To allow the description of complex properties, it also contains terms for unordered, two-dimensional lists.The BPO s bpo is on the schematic description of product only, not including geometry or material compositions. Therefore, it can be used to describe theoretical product components without geometric representations as well as those with geometric representations without restrictions. For classification purposes, it uses the buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD) by referencing to the terms bSDD GUID. If geometric descriptions are desired for components, the authors suggest to use the Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG, https://w3id.org/omg) resp. the File Ontology for Geometry formats (FOG, https://w3id.org/omg).The BPO is based on the SolConPro ontology, which was first presented in:Wagner, A., Moeller, L.K., Leifgen, C., Rueppel, U., (2018).

"CARESSES Ontology","http://caressesrobot.org/ontology","The CARESSES Ontology encodes guidelines defined by experts in Transcultural Nursing, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing social assistive robots (assisting older adults) with cultural competence.As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? - Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?- Topics of conversation. Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?The CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.Please refer to the following for additional information:- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.

Core entities are named using natural language names that are easily understood eg Group, Context or Find. Associated entities are then named accordingly. For example, if we take a Group, an event relating to this group would be referred to as a GroupEvent. The record of such an event taking place would be a GroupEventRecord and an associated note would be referred to as a GroupEventRecordNote. If this note was classified by type the classification would be a GroupEventRecordNoteType. Similarly, if we take a Find (referred to as a ContextFind in the model in order to reinforce the idea that all finds originate from a context, even if the context is unknown), then we can see that it was produced as part of a ContextFindProductionEvent which took place at a ContextFindProductionEventLocation.","Ceri Binding, University of South Wales","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=http://purl.org/crmeh#CRMEH","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fcrmeh%23CRMEH&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fcrmeh%23CRMEH&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fcrmeh%23CRMEH&f=ttl","2014-10-29","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

"CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology","http://purl.org/spar/cito","CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL to enable characterization of the nature or type of citations, both factually and rhetorically, and to permit these descriptions to be published on the Web. The citations characterized may be either direct and explicit (as in the reference list of a journal article), indirect (e.g. a citation to a more recent paper by the same research group on the same topic), or implicit (e.g. as in artistic quotations or parodies, or in cases of plagiarism).CiTO contains the object property cito:cites and its sub-properties, and its inverse property cito:isCitedBy, from the original Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO v1.6. Upon the creation of version 2.0 of CiTO, a number of new sub-properties of cito:cites were added, and the inverse properties of all the sub-properties of cito:cites were created, all of which are sub-properties of cito:isCitedBy. The ontology has also been integrated with the SWAN Discourse Relationships Ontology by making cito:cites a sub-property of http://purl.org/swan/2.0/discourse-relationships/refersTo.Restrictions of domain and range present in the previous version of CiTO were removed from the object properties when creating CiTO v 2.0, permitting its independent use in other contexts, in addition to conventional bibliographic citations. So that they can be used independently, other entities that were previously included in CiTO v1.6 have now been made components of other SPAR ontologies: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology; C4O, the Citation Counting and Context Characterization Ontology; and PSO, the Publication Status Ontology. The addition of two new properties:cito:usesConclusionsFrom and its inverse cito:providesConclusionsFor on 09Dec2011 led to a version number increment from v2.0 to v2.1.The addition of two additional properties, cito:compiles and cito:isCompiledBy, previously in the deprecated CiTO4Data ontology, on 03 July 2012 led to a version increment from v2.1 to v2.2.Subsequent expansions include:in versions 2.3 and 2.4 the addition of the object properties cito:citesAsPotentialSolution, cito:citesAsRecommendedReading, cito:repliesTo, cito:retracts, cito:speculates on, and their inverse properties;in v2.5 the addition of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationEvent, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity;in v 2.6: renaming cito:hasCitationEvent to become cito:hasCitationCharacterization;improving definitions of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationCharacterization, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity;revising the definition of cito:isCompiledBy to correct it and bring it into line with the DataCite Metadata Kernel v2.2 definition;changing the definition of cito:sharesAuthorsWith from An object property indicating that the citing entity has at least one author in common with the cited entity. to An object property between two entities indicating that they have at least one author in common. so that it can be used when one entity does not actually cite the other;adding the object properties cito:hasRelatedEntity, cito:sharesFundingAgencyWith and cito:sharesAuthorInstitutionWith;and adding the text An object property indicating that . . . at the beginning of the textual definition (rdfs:comment) for each CiTO object property.in v 2.6.1:Removed text An object property indicating that . . . added in v 2.6 at the beginning of the textual definition (rdfs:comment) for each CiTO object property, so that each definition is just a direct statement of the relationship. Removed the property cito:hasRelatedEntity (in favour of using dcterms:relation).Renamed cito:hasReply to become cito:hasReplyFrom.Improved the textual definitions of cito:derides and its inverse property.in v 2.6.2:Improved definitions of of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationCharacterization, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity.in v 2.6.3:Added examples for each citation type (i.e., all the subproperties of cito:cites).in v 2.6.4:Added alignment with schema:citation.in v 2.7.0:Added new property cito:linksTo, and corrected some property URL.in v 2.7.1Corrected some typos in property comments.in v 2.7.2The name of the class cito:CitationAct has been changed to cito:Citation, and its definition has been modified. The property cito:hasCitationTimeSpan has been added.in v 2.7.3Added the class cito:SelfCitation, i.e. citation in which the citing and the cited entities have at least one author in common.in v 2.8Renamed the class cito:SelfCitation in cito:AuthorSelfCitation. Created a new class cito:SelfCitation with a more general definition (citation in which the citing and the cited entities have something significant in common with one another), which now includes five subclasses: cito:AuthorSelfCitation, cito:JournalSelfCitation, cito:FunderSelfCitation, cito:AffiliationSelfCitation, cito:AuthorNetworkSelfCitation. The latter class is also accompanied by the new data property cito:hasCoAuthorCitationLevel, which specifies the minimal distance that one of the authors of a citing entity has with regards to one of the authors of a cited entity according to their co-author network. Added the object properties cito:sharesPublicationVenueWith and its subproperty cito:sharesJournalWith. Added the data property cito:hasCitationCreationDate, and changed the domain of cito:hasCitationTimeSpan with xsd:duration.in v 2.8.1Renamed the property cito:hasCoAuthorCitationLevel in cito:hasCoAuthorshipCitationLevel.The Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) is an ontology that enables characterization of the nature or type of citations, both factually and rhetorically.**URL:** http://purl.org/spar/cito**Creators**: [David Shotton](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5506-523X), [Silvio Peroni](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-4305)**Contributors:** [Paolo Ciccarese](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5156-2703), [Tim Clark](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4060-7360)**License:** [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)**Website:** http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/cito**Cite as:** Peroni, S., Shotton, D.

"Comparative Data Analysis Ontology","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cdao.owl","The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis. This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein. In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units). The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities. The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the character-state data model . For a given character, such as beak length , each OTU has a state, such as short or long . The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree. CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters. The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.","CDAO Team","","","","","","","","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cdao.owl","","2024-04-11","Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/api/ontologies"

Main aspects in which DOLCE+DnS Ultralite departs from DOLCE Lite-Plus are the following:- The names of classes and relations have been made more intuitive- The DnS-related part is closer to the newer constructive DnS ontology (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/cDnS.owl).- Temporal and spatial relations are simplified- Qualities and regions are more relaxed than in DOLCE-Full: they can be used as attributes of any entity, although two axioms state that each quality has a region and viceversa- Axiomatization makes use of simpler constructs than DOLCE Lite-Plus- The architecture of the ontology is pattern-based, which means that DOLCE+DnS Ultralite is also available in modules, called content ontology design patterns , which can be applied independently in the design of domain ontologies (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org). If many modules are needed in a same ontology project, it is anyway useful to use this integrated version.The final result is a lightweight, easy-to-apply foundational ontology for modeling either physical or social contexts.Several extensions of DOLCE+DnS Ultralite have been designed; see for example the extensions for information objects: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl, for systems: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/SystemsLite.owl, for plans: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/PlansLite.owl, for the legal domain: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/CLO/CoreLegal.owl, and for the lexical and semiotic domains: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L2.owl; etc.","","","","http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Ontology:DOLCE+DnS_Ultralite","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/dul/versions/2017-04-10.n3","","","","2017-04-10","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

It has been re-worked to align entirely with the W3C s [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO). This is because PROV, to which this ontology is completely mapped, does not have a templating system which can indicate what *should* occur in future scenarios.This ontology introduces only one new element for decision modelling over that which was present in the DO: an Agent which allows agency in decision making to be recorded.This ontology is for modelling decisions and thus the causes for actions or the use or generation of things.

The aim of the protocol is to provide a brief overview of their health status of the participants during consultation (cognition, behaviours and function), and to correlate the system (sensor) data with the data collected using typical dementia care assessment tools.The ontology describes the basic Steps of the experimentation protocol (Directed Activities, Semi-directed Activities and Free Discussion with the Clinician), the Tasks that are involved, as well as the measurement types relevant to each Task. The defined protocol can be reused and further extended, adding new steps, tasks and measured data.Documentation regarding the ontology vocabulary can be found at http://www.demcare.eu/ontologies/demlab.html","","","","http://www.demcare.eu/ontologies/demlab.html","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/demlab/versions/2014-09-02.n3","","","","2014-09-02","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Description Banking Archives Ontology","https://w3id.org/dba/ontology/","The ontology, presented here in a beta version, is based on the analysis of the documentation and descriptive requirements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Historical Archive and is intended to describe the content of historical banking documents and of some of the activities carried out by the bank, particularly in relation to third parties (loans, charity donations, seizures and confiscations, etc.), which involve the initiation of processes or the production of documents. The focal point of the descriptive model is the bank - an entity that initiates different types of processes, whose common feature is that they are structured into various stages/events - and the relationship between the documentation produced and the information it contains. In fact, this ontology is based on information collected from archived documents which describe various processes and activities carried out by banking institutions: the starting point for its construction were the inventories and databases of documentation stored in the Historical Archive which was produced by the various banks that over time were merged into Intesa Sanpaolo. The ontology was created to provide a sufficiently abstract representation and model for describing the processes of various banking activities from which the documentation was produced - from a company s request for financing and its outcome, to the preparation of seizure, confiscation and asset restitution filings, to charitable contributions, just to mention a few examples - reusing models that were already well established and widely used. The structure of the proposed ontology is in fact intended to adapt to the various activities, described in the archive files that a banking institution performs in relation to third parties. The proposed ontology is therefore not an ontology on banking activity in general, but on the relationship between this activity and the documents that are produced. Moreover, its objective is not to describe the documents in the strict sense of the term, for which reference is made to OAD ontology. The purpose of this project is to lay the initial, and fundamental, building blocks for describing the complexity, variety, and breadth of the domain of archiving bank records and the data they contain. Despite having data from different banks relating to different activities and having already made arrangements for the integration of third-party datasets and ontologies, before completing the project we will have to wait for the processing of representations based on other types of documents and banking institutions, including non-Italian ones.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/dba/versions/2022-01-05.n3","","","","2022-01-05","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"EBU Ontology","http://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore","Guidelines: for the purpose of flexibility and interoperability with a wider range of implementations, some properties purposefully do not have a range and accept either a resource or a literal. When a resource is used, it is recommended to reuse objects defined in the model (e.g. pair hasEvent/Event or hasRole/Role). Example 1: x hasRole actor . Example 2: x hasRole _:Role_1 (a reference to the Concept Id from a SKOS Role vocabulary defined in the ontology). Note to implementers: The EBUCore ontology is used by a variety of users with different needs. Several EBUCore properties have no range to allow different implementations using entities or literals. As an implementer, it is your choice to go for one or the other for each property to have consistent expectations when parsing individuals. EBUCore also provides different classes defined as subclasses of skos:Concept. You can use these classes as entities in range of several properties currently left without range. EBUCore is expressed in RDF in order to facilitate such modelling and flexibility. As a consequence, propoerties appear in the documentation as annotation properties. The EBUCore has been designed to make users benefit from the flexibility of RDF to adapt the names of Classes and properties to their respective needs. This means users are welcome to add their own subclasses (e.g. to define the most appropriate BusinessObjects or Resources or Agents) and subproperties.","","","Copyright 2015 EBU","http://tech.ebu.ch/lang/en/MetadataEbuCore","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/ebucore/versions/2015-08-04.n3","","","","2015-08-04","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Execution-Executor-Procedure ODP","https://w3id.org/eep","The Execution-Executor-Procedure (EEP) ODP imports the AffectedBy ODP (https://w3id.org/affectedBy), that involves classes for Features of Interest and their intrinsic Properties/Qualities. The EEP ODP is an adaptation of the Procedure Execution Ontology (PEP) (https://w3id.org/pep/pep-1.1) from the SEAS ontology which, in turn, is a generalization of the Observation-Sensor-Procedure and Actuation-Actuator-Procedure patterns used in the SOSA (http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/) and SSN (http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/) ontologies.From the AffectedBy ODP, the EEP ODP imports the notion that a property/quality is intrinsic to the feature of interest that it belongs to (i.e., according to the definition of the class Quality in the DUL ontology http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl).Apart from the two classes imported from the AffectedBy ODP (aff:FeatureOfIntetest and aff:Quality), the EEP ODP consists of three more classes: Execution, Executor, and Procedure. The class Execution and their three functional object properties: eep:madeBy, eep:usedProcedure, and eep:onQuality, forms the backbone of the ODP. The property eep:madeBy links an execution to its executor, the property eep:usedProcedure links an execution to its procedure, and the property eep:onQuality links an execution to the quality/property concerned by the execution. Therefore, an execution jointly with their three object values of the three aforementioned properties can be considered as a n-ary relationship. Note that every quality belongs to unique feature of interest. Therefore, a feature of interest is involved in the n-ary relationship.The remaining object properties: eep:implements, that links executors to procedures, eep:hasFeatureOfInteres, that links executions to features of interest, eep:forQuality, that links executors to qualities, and eep:forFeatureOfInterest, that links executors to features of interest, are defined in terms of the functional object properties using property chain axioms.","Iker Esnaola-Gonzalez Jesús Bermúdez","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=https://w3id.org/eep","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Feep&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Feep&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Feep&f=ttl","2018-09-01","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

"FIESTA-IoT","http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot#","Many testbeds owning devices or applications interacting with the sensors, store their inherent observations and other related data in their own proprietary format. In other words, making a testbed independent and isolated from others that cannot directly interact with each other. Differences in the data format lead to interoperability issues between the testbeds and much work has to be done in order to ensure the compatibility. One has to understand different data formats and create the mapping between them. As a result, a testbed must understand other testbed s format and create the mapping both while sending and receiving information. One method to accomplish interoperability is through the usage of semantic-based technologies to annotate all the information shared by the platforms. Nevertheless, some of the relevant existing ontologies promise interoperability but: - do not address the problem to describe the observation in an interoperable manner to ease further tasks, such as reasoning, - many of them are domain-specific and cannot be applied across domains, - they have missing concepts and do not suffice the needs of the measurements provided by the sensors, and - many ontologies do not follow best practices making it hard to correctly interpret and reuse concepts.In order to address the above-mentioned limitations, we provide FIESTA-IoT ontology (a unified semantic model) that follows best practices. FIESTA-IoT Ontology is a merge of concepts from various ontologies such as IoT-lite, M3-lite Taxonomy, SSN, Time and DUL (see Figure 1). The FIESTA-IoT Ontology is divided into 2 parts: resource description and observations produced. One has to follow the Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, for understanding what all concepts are associated with resource description and observation. Using such information testbeds can annotate their data to FIESTA-IoT specific requirements and the annotators developed can achieve FIESTA-IoT certification. For reference we provide sample annotations as figure (see Figure 4 and Figure 5) for both resource graph and observation graph.For more details please see:- R. Agarwal, D. Fernandez, T. Elsaleh, A.

Please report any errors to rachit.agarwal@inria.fr. After a thorough analysis of existing Internet of Things (IoT) related ontologies, we propose FIESTA-IoT Ontology that aims to achieve semantic interoperability among heterogeneous testbeds. The Ontology is framed within the EU H2020 FIESTA-IoT project, that aims to seamlessly support the federation of testbeds through the usage of semantic-based technologies.

However, they also include blogs, web pages, datasets, computer algorithms, experimental protocols, formal specifications and vocabularies, legal records, governmental papers, technical and commercial reports and similar publications, and also anthologies, catalogues and similar collections. FaBiO classes are structured according to the FRBR schema of Works, Expressions, Manifestations and Items. Additional properties have been added to extends the FRBR data model by linking Works and Manifestations (fabio:hasManifestation and fabio:isManifestationOf), Works and Items (fabio:hasPortrayal and fabio:isPortrayedBy), and Expressions and Items (fabio:hasRepresentation and fabio:isRepresentedBy).The FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO) is an ontology for describing entities that are published or potentially publishable (e.g., journal articles, conference papers, books), and that contain or are referred to by bibliographic references.**URL:** http://purl.org/spar/fabio**Creators**: [David Shotton](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5506-523X), [Silvio Peroni](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-4305)**Contributors:** [Paolo Ciccarese](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5156-2703), [Tim Clark](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4060-7360)**License:** [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)**Website:** http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/fabio**Cite as:** Peroni, S., Shotton, D.

"Funding, Research Administration and Projects Ontology","http://purl.org/cerif/frapo/","FRAPO is an ontology for use to describe research project administrative information and to work with CRIS (Current Research Information Systems). It can be used for the characterization of grant applications, funding bodies, projects, project partners, etc. It can also be used to describe other types of projects, for example building projects and educational projects. FRAPO imports FOAF and is designed to work with SCoRO, the Scholarly Contributions and Roles Ontology (http://purl.org/spar/scoro/), which is used to characterize the contributions and time-limited roles that may exist between agents such as people and organizations and entities such as projects, research investigations or research outputs. FaBiO, the FRBR-alightned bibliographic ontology (http://purl.org/spar/fabio/), provides terms for documents of relevance, such as grant applications, project plans, project reports, datasets and journal articles, which are therefore not included within FRAPO.FRAPO is not intended to describe the details of research investigations enabled by funded research projects, nor their component studies and assays, which are the domain of a complementary ontology, ISA-RDF (under development - add URL).FRAPO, the Funding, Research Administration and Projects Ontology, is a CERIF-compliant ontology written in OWL 2 DL for describing research project administrative information.

"Human Reference Atlas Common Coordinate Framework Ontology","http://purl.org/ccf/ccf.owl","The Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) Ontology is an application ontology built to support the development of the Human Reference Atlas (HRA). It unifies vocabulary for HRA construction and usage—making it possible to ingest external data sources; supporting uniform tissue sample registration that includes the spatial positioning and semantic annotations within 3D reference organs; and supporting user-formulated cross-domain queries over tissue donor properties, anatomical structures, cell types, biomarkers, and 3D space. The CCF Ontology consists of three major ontologies. The Biological Structure Ontology records anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B) and the relationships between them. The ASCT+B tables are authored by human experts using templated Google Sheets. The biomarkers, cell types, and anatomical structures are mapped to existing ontologies (Uberon/FMA, CL, HGNC) whenever possible. All relationships between anatomical structures and from cell types to anatomical structures are valid Uberon and CL relationships. The Spatial Ontology defines the shape, size, location, and rotation of experimental tissue and data major anatomical structures in the 3D Reference Object Library. The Specimen Ontology captures the sex, age, and other information on donors that provided tissue data used in the construction of the HRA.Contact: Katy Börner (katy@indiana.edu), Bruce W.

For example, the Hard Disk Problem class being defined by a specific restriction that is being linked to at least one of the symptoms Error Reading File or Error Writing File (instances of Symptom class). Thus, resources can be classified based on the description of their symptoms, as an instance of the new class of Hard Disk Problem (HD).Vocabulary for describing issues (or problems) and corresponding symptoms and solutions to a broad variety of contexts. It is intended to provide a generic, reusable core ontology that can be extended or specialized for use in domain-specific situations, aimed at supporting linked data publishing. The solutions are represented by procedures, which are possible workflows for solving corresponding issues.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/ipo/versions/2015-07-30.n3","","","","2015-07-30","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

The following diagram shows the main RiC-CM v0.2 entities and a few relations between them: RiC-O design principles The following design principles were followed when developing RiC-O. RiC-O is a domain or reference ontology. It provides a generic vocabulary and formal rules for creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record resource. It can support publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data, querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of the ontology. While some projects have built some specific ontologies for describing archives, at this time no generic domain ontology exists for the specific needs of the archival community. This is why EGAD decided to develop RiC-O as the second part of RiC standard. Apart this first, main target, RiC-O also can help archival institutions and engineers to design and develop other technical implementations of RiC-CM that represent record resources and their layers of contexts as oriented, interconnected graphs. Of course, other technical implementations may be developed later on, including XML models, or (hopefully) new versions of EAD and EAC-CPF XML models. As RiC-O is a generic, domain ontology, it does not address by itself every specific need or expectation that may occur in every archival institution or project. It is rather a high level framework and a project can either limit itself to the use of a selection of components, or can add more subcomponents where needed. As a domain ontology, RiC-O, at this stage at least, does not borrow any component from other existing ontologies (such as the cultural heritage models – IFLA-LRM and CIDOC-CRM, PREMIS, or PROV-O). It should therefore be easier, for an archival institution or archival project, to understand, implement and maintain RiC-O within its system. Later on, RiC-O will be aligned with these existing models. This is of course essential for interconnecting RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O with other datasets, or for using parts of RiC-O in other contexts than the archival or records management realm. RiC-O must be immediately usable. This is a key feature for a new model. In particular, it is very important that existing archival metadata, that are created or generated in current information systems, can be converted to RDF conforming to RiC-O, without losing any data, structural or partially implicit information. What is at stake here is that metadata conforming to the previous existing ICA standards can be processed successfully. During the ongoing development process, a lot of successful testing has been made, using XML/EAD finding aids and XML/EAC-CPF authority records, that have been converted to RDF datasets, either by hand or using scripts. A conversion software is being developed and will soon be available. While some existing metadata sets may have a very fine level of granularity and accuracy, already using, for example, controlled vocabularies, or describing curation events separately, often these metadata don’t have the very precise structure that RiC-CM recommends. Even then, such a conversion process should remain possible. In order to allow this, RiC-O sometimes provides several methods for representing information (as described below). From this point of view, the current official version of RiC-O may be considered a transitional ontology, in which some components may be deprecated later on. The usability of a model also depends on its documentation. That’s why the current official release has been fully documented (this documentation will be continously improved). RiC-O will also soon be acompanied with examples (RDF datasets). Some tutorials should also be written, and EGAD will organize practical workshops. RiC-O has to provide a flexible framework. This is a very important principle too. It is related with the usability principle quoted above. Moreover, archival description is flexible by essence. It is quite commonly noted that the level of granularity of information varies from one finding aid to another (or from one authority record to another), or even within the same finding aid. Some series or agents are described summarily because little is known about them and there is little time for extensive research, while other series, even records, or agents are described in detail; some relations (e.g. that relating to provenance) may be described without any detail while others may be thoroughly documented, as ISAAR(CPF) and EAC-CPF allow it. Being generally flexible, for an OWL ontology, depends first on the polyhierarchical systems of classes and properties it provides. A superproperty or superclass, more general or generic than its subproperties or subclasses, must exist and be available for handling information, while at the same time more accurate subcomponents must be there for handling more accurate description. Also, RiC-O should provide several methods for expressing whether relations are well attested and certain, or are more vague, as well as direct and short paths between entities alongside more complex ones. RiC-O opens new potential for archival description. This means that Linked Data tools and interfaces should enable end users to go through RDF/RiC-O graphs, to query them using SPARQL in an efficient way and to consult archival metadata and their contexts in new ways. As an example, an end user should be able to ask « What are (according to your dataset) the corporate bodies that succeeded to this given entity from its end of existence, by 1840, to nowadays (as concerns this given activity) ?» or « tell me what instantiations of this photograph exist? » « what are the existing copies of this original charter?», and get a list of these entities. In other words, institutions or projects that make the effort to implement RiC-O will get new insight into the content and context of their archives that wasn t visible with the existing ICA-standards. It should be even more interesting if you can infer new assertions from the RDF datasets you built, and of course link your datasets to other ressources outside of your institution. RiC-O should be extensible. Institutions are free to extend the ontology by adding new subclasses or subproperties if needed. RiC-O has also the potential to be useable in other contexts than purely archival ones. This implies that hierarchies of classes and properties are defined and that mappings are developed with other ontologies as mentioned above. It may also imply that RiC-O should provide “hooks” enabling connections with, for example, existing SKOS vocabularies. Understanding RiC-O: a quick overview of some features From RiC-CM to RiC-O In the system of classes of RiC-O, for each RiC-CM entity, you can find a corresponding class. These classes are organized according to the same hierarchy as in RiC-CM. In some projects, you may need very few of them (e.g. Agent, Record Resource and Activity only), while in other ones, you may need more (e.g. Corporate Body and Person; Record; Place; Provenance Relation). Certain classes only exist in RiC-O and not in RiC-CM. These additional classes address special needs: some correspond to RiC-CM attributes, when it may be considered necessary to handle them as full entities. This is the case for Type and its subclasses, that correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain controlled values, and that can help to articulate RiC-O with external RDF resources like SKOS vocabularies; and also for Language, Name and Identifier, that can be considered as full entities and as key linking nodes in a RDF graph. All these classes have been grouped under a Concept class. some classes have been added in order to provide a more accurate definition and model for some entities. Place thus comes along with a Physical Location class, and with a Coordinates class. A Place is considered both a geographical and historical entity. As a historical entity, among other features, it has a history, and may be preceded or succeeded by other Places. A Place also may have zero to many Physical Location through time (for instance, its boundaries, if it is an administrative area or a country, may change). Each Physical Location may be connected to zero to many Coordinates. This model is quite close to the Linked Places Format (https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places). Another example of such an addition is the Proxy class, that represents (stands for) a Record Resource as it exists in a specific Record Set. finally, a system of classes helps to implement the Relations section of RiC-CM. While these relations also are represented as simple, binary object properties (e.g. ‘hasProvenance’ that corresponds to RiC-R026 relation), you may need to assign different attributes to a relation, e.g. a date, certainty or description, as it is already possible, and quite often done, in a XML/EAC-CPF file. One of the standard available methods for representing such a documented relation in RDF for now is to use a class. RDF* and SPARQL* specification, which is being developed by the W3C RDF-DEV Community Group, provides a far simpler method (allowing to consider a triple as the subject or object of another triple; see https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/) and is already being used by some tools; however it is not yet a W3C standard. Thus, for example, in RiC-O an AgentOriginationRelation class exists. This class may connect one to many Agents to one to many created or accumulated Record Resources or Instantiations, and has some specific object properties (certainty, date, description, source). Back to the ‘hasProvenance’ object property, let us add that it is formally defined in RiC-O, using OWL 2 property chain axiom (see https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/, as a ‘shortcut’ for the longer path ‘recordResourceOrInstantiationIsSourceOfAgentOriginationRelation/agentOriginationRelationHasTarget’, where the intermediate node is an instance of Agent Origination Relation: A triplestore, with the appropriate configuration, may thus infer the direct ‘hasProvenance’ assertion from this long path. Most of the datatype properties in RiC-O correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain free, plain text. See for example rico:descriptiveNote, rico:history and rico:scopeAndContent. In addition to these datatype properties, the Name and Identifier RiC-CM attributes also have corresponding classes (subclasses of rico:Appellation). A resource may have several Identifiers and each comes with different attributes (e.g. archival reference code, system number, digital object identifier), in this case the identifiers will be modelled in a class. In many simpler usecases it s sufficent to just use the identifier datatype property, typically for the archival reference code. The Location RiC-CM attribute also has a rico:Physical Location corresponding class (for users who want to use Place, Physical Location and Coordinates for handling places). As already said too, every RiC-CM attribute that has ‘controlled value’ or ‘rule-based’ as a schema value, has a class as corresponding component in RiC-O. For these CM attributes that correspond to a RiC-O class, as it is necessary to provide an immediately usable ontology, two supplementary datatype properties exist that allow not to use the classes, at least for a while, if you want to implement RiC-O and create RiC-O/RDF datasets from existing archival metadata without being able to handle URIs for the information you have. For example, you may not be able to handle and maintain URIs for some controlled values you use in EAD finding aids for carrier types: maybe your information system does not use a vocabulary for this, and you cannot for a while consider these carrier types as full entities. Nevertheless you want to produce RiC-O datasets where every piece of information is kept, and you want to avoid blank nodes. If RiC-O would only provide the Carrier Type class, it would be an issue for you. So RiC-O provides a rico:type datatype property, with range rdfs:literal, which allows you to move forward. Therefore, for the RiC-CM *Type attributes, you have a corresponding rico:type datatype property. For RiC-CM Coordinates attribute, you also have rico:geographicalCoordinates datatype property. These datatype properties have a skos:scopeNote which says (for example) Provided for usability reasons. May be made deprecated or removed later on. Use only if you don t use Physical Location and Coordinates classes with Place. The same key design principle (RiC-O must be immediately usable) led us to define some datatype properties that would enable users to use RiC-O in simple usecases where they do not want to consider dates and rules as full entities. Thus, there of course is Date and Rule classes in RiC-O (since there are Date and Rule entities in RiC-CM). And you also have date datatype properties; plus a rico:ruleFollowed datatype property. The same analysis led us to keep the rico:history datatype property in RiC-O (same as RiC-CM history attribute), while RiC-CM and RiC-O also provide the Event class, and using a series of Events may of course be a better method, easier to query, link and display, than simply using a history prose discourse. The two methods may be used in parallel within the same dataset by an institution that, for example, would decide to emphasize only the accession, appraisal and description events among the whole history of Record resources. These datatype properties have the same kind of skos:scopeNote as above. Finally, we have introduced a few datatype properties that do not correspond to any RiC-CM attribute. Some are superproperties, and thus group datatype properties (rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent, with rico:carrierExtent, rico:instantiationExtent and rico:recordResourceExtent as subproperties ; rico:textualValue, with rico:expressedDate and rico:normalizedValue as subproperties; rico:measure (and its subproperties); rico:referenceSystem, superproperty of rico:dateStandard (and of other datatype properties that do not exist in RiC-CM.) Some are simply more specific properties : rico:accrualStatus ; rico:recordResourceStructure and rico:instantiationStructure, subproperties of rico:structure ; rico:title (subproperty of rico:name) ; rico:altitude, rico:latitude, rico:longitude (subproperties of rico:measure), rico:geodesicSystem and rico:altimetricSystem (subproperties of rico:referenceSystem). In order to connect all the classes created, a significant number of object properties have been defined. While their flat list is a long one, they are grouped hierarchically, so that one can use the upper to intermediate level ones for simplicity sake, or choose the most accurate and expressive ones, or extend the system adding a subproperty easily. It is expected that, in most use cases, a subset of these properties only will be needed. As already said above, some of the object properties are also formally defined as shortcuts. Finally, let us mention that we added to RiC-O six individuals, considering that they would address current and frequent needs: Two (FindingAid and AuthorityRecord) are instances of both RiC-O Documentary Form Type and SKOS Concept. They can be used for categorizing Records, finding aids and authority records being considered as Records. A Record that would have ‘Finding Aid’ as a Documentary Form Type, can be connected to one to many Record Resources using rico:describes’ object property. Four (Fonds, Series, File, and Collection) are both instances of the Record Set Type class, and of skos:Concept. Their definition is taken from the ISAD(G) glossary. They can be used for categorizing Record Sets. In the future, we can imagine that many other categories of the kind will be defined by the archival community, forming at least rich SKOS (hopefully multilingual) vocabularies. Considering the concepts thus defined as being also instances of some RiC-O classes may be of great interest for producing a richer description (for example, an instance of the Documentary Form Type class may have a history and some temporal relations to other documentary form types). RiC-O documentation and annotation properties Each class or property has at least an English label (rdfs:label) and description (rdfs:comment). Some have a skos:scopeNote or a skos:example. When a RiC-O class or property corresponds in a way to a RiC-CM component, its description and scope note are, either the same as, or derived from, their definition and scope note in RiC-CM. We have created two annotation properties, subproperties of rdfs:comment, for handling: Information about the corresponding RiC-CM component when appliable (rico:RiCCMCorrespondingComponent). Various phrasings are used in this property depending on the rule applied for defining the RiC-CM component. Information, most often in prose text for now, about possible mappings with other models or ontologies (rico:closeTo, rarely used in this 0.1 version)). Finally, in this official 0.2 release, any change in the definition of a class or property, since December 2019, is documented using a skos:changeNote. Next steps The following is a non exhaustive list of known issues, topics or tasks on which EGAD has begun to work and will continue to work in the next months: providing more examples of known implementations of RiC-O in different institutions and contexts. The goal is to show different practices on how RiC-O is being implemented. We have begun to release such examples in the public RiC-O repository on GitHub. One can also have a look at the Projects and tools page on RiC-O website. finishing the system of relations (where some subclasses are still missing) assessing, and changing in some cases, the tense of the verbs in some object properties (e.g. for the properties that correspond to some RiC-CM relations). This has been done, following RiC-CM v0.2 updates, where many relations have changed name so that they can be used for recording both past and present situations. articulating the Event and Activity classes, and the Relation system of classes improving the names of object properties. This has been done, following RiC-CM v0.2 updates and applying a few naming rules, so that, for example, the same verb is used for naming a relation and the inverse relation when it exists. adding suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL equivalences between some classes or properties and components in other models (among which - this is not an exhaustive list- CIDOC-CRM, IFLA-LRM, PREMIS, PROV-O, Wikidata and Schema.org) documenting RiC-O in French and Spanish providing users with some SPARQL constructs for inferring.","","","Copyright 2019-...., International Council on Archives (ICA)","https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_v0-2.html","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/rico/versions/2021-02-12.n3","","","","2021-02-12","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Lexical MetaModel Level 1","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl","This ontology is a composition of some content design patterns for the semiotic triangle.Its structure is extracted from DOLCE-Ultralite (DOLCE+c.DnS), but it uses a different terminology, and explicitly defines the semiotic function: Expression is the semiotic term for dul:InformationObject, when they actually express or denote something; Meaning is the semiotic term for dul:SocialObject, when they are actually expressed by something, or are interpretation of something; Reference is the semiotic term for dul:Entity, when they are interpreted or denoted by something.The denotes relation is equivalent to dul:isAbout, the expresses relation is imported from DOLCE Ultralite, and the hasInterpretation relation generalizes over: dul:isClassifiedBy, dul:isCoveredBy, dul:isDescribedBy, dul:isUnifiedBy, and dul:satisfiesExtensions to the triangle:A typical extension of the semiotic triangle concerns the participation of agents: this is introduced by using the dul:conceptualizes relation, holding between a dul:Agent and a dul:SocialObject (the Meaning). An additional extension concerns semiotic context: this is provided by including four notions of Context : Paradigm (the context of the conceptualized meaning), KnowledgeCollective (the context of agents that conceptualize the paradigm), Cotext (the context of expressions), and dul:Situation (the context of denoted entities).A final extension links semiotics to formal semantics: this is provided by reusing dul:FormalEntity, iol:isGroundingFor, iol:FormalExpression, iol:isAssignedTo, iol:FormalLanguage, etc.The complete pattern allows to declare relations between Expression(s) and their Reference(s) (denotes), between Expression(s) and their Meaning (dul:expresses), between Meaning(s) and Reference(s) (isInterpretationOf), between Reference(s) and dul:FormalEntity(ies) (iol:isGroundingFor), between dul:FormalEntity(ies) and iol:FormalExpression(s) (iol:isAssignedTo).This formalization pathway moves from Expression(s) to iol:FormalExpression(s) by taking into account both Meaning(s) and Referent(s). The informal denotation of Expression(s) is moved to a formal denotation (iol:isAssignedTo) of iol:FormalExpression(s).For example: the Expression Mariachi dul:expresses the dul:Concept (Meaning) MexicanStreetSinger that isInterpretationOf the dul:Collection (Reference) TheStreetSingersFromMexico . TheStreetSingersFromMexico then iol:isGroundingFor e.g. the dul:Set (dul:FormalEntity) that includes all Mexican street singers, which iol:isAssignedTo e.g. the iol:FormalExpression owl:Class#Mariachi .The formalization pathway enables a technique to move from/to socio-cognitive and formal semantics through denotation, in the Tarskian sense. As a matter of fact, translating directly a Meaning into a FormalEntity (or viceversa) is not always clearly implementable, while passing through an extensional grounding is easier and more accessible to intuition.Among possible uses, information extraction, ontology learning, KOS reengineering, lexical semantics, etc. For example, statistical learning of instances for a dul:Concept would be modelled as the building of a dul:Collection that isInterpretationOf the dul:Concept, but also dul:isGroundingFor a dul:Set that iol:isAssignedTo e.g. an owl:Class.An additional semiotic pattern is based on the hasInterpretant relation, which allows to link two Expression(s) (or dul:InformationRealization(s)), when the second one counts as a Meaning (or a relatedMeaning) of the first. In practice, this is implemented by allowing a relation between an Expression (or its realization), and whatever Meaning (or another dul:InformationRealization). Technically speaking, the correct path would be passing through another Expression used to express a Meaning for the first one:(Exp1 hasInterpretant some (Exp2 and expresses some (Meaning and isExpressedBy some Exp1)))or even:(Exp1 hasInterpretant some (Exp2 and expresses some (Meaning and relatedMeaning some (Meaning and isExpressedBy some Exp1))))but given the expressive power of OWL, which lacks co-reference, this is the best sub-optimal solution.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/lmm1/versions/2010-02-09.n3","","","","2010-02-09","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

Names descriptions also provide access to a controlled form of name through references from unused forms, e.g. a search under: Snodgrass, Quintus Curtius, 1835-1910 will lead users to the authoritative name for Mark Twain, which is, Twain, Mark, 1835-1910. Names may also be used as subjects in bibliographic descriptions, so they may be combined with controlled values from subject heading schemes, such as LCSH. Library of Congress Names includes over 8 million descriptions created over many decades and according to different cataloging policies.

"Library of","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects","Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) has been actively maintained since 1898 to catalog materials held at the Library of Congress. By virtue of cooperative cataloging other libraries around the United States also use LCSH to provide subject access to their collections. In addition LCSH is used internationally, often in translation. LCSH in this service includes all Library of Congress Subject Headings, free-floating subdivisions (topical and form), Genre/Form headings, Children s (AC) headings, and validation strings* for which authority records have been created. The content includes a few name headings (personal and corporate), such as William Shakespeare, Jesus Christ, and Harvard University, and geographic headings that are added to LCSH as they are needed to establish subdivisions, provide a pattern for subdivision practice, or provide reference structure for other terms. This content is expanded beyond the print issue of LCSH (the red books ) with inclusion of validation strings. *Validation strings: Some authority records are for headings that have been built by adding subdivisions. These records are the result of an ongoing project to programmatically create authority records for valid subject strings from subject heading strings found in bibliographic records. The authority records for these subject strings were created so the entire string could be machine-validated.

"Linked Science Core Vocabulary","http://linkedscience.org/lsc/ns#","LSC, the Linked Science Core Vocabulary, is a lightweight vocabulary providing terms to enable publishers and researchers to relate things in science to time, space, and themes. More precisely, LSC is designed for describing scientific resources including elements of research, their context, and for interconnecting them. We introduce LSC as an example of building blocks for Linked Science to communicate the linkage between scientific resources in a machine-understandable way. The “core” in the name refers to the fact that LSC only defines the basic terms for science. We argue that the success of Linked Science—or Linked Data in general—lies in interconnected, yet distributed vocabularies that minimize ontological commitments. More specific terms needed by different scientific communities can therefore be introduced as extensions of LSC. LSC is hosted at LinkedScience.org; please check also other available vocabularies at LinkedScience.org/vocabularies.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/lsc/versions/2011-11-29.n3","","","","2011-11-29","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of Metadata4Ing.Metadata4Ing does not import complete ontologies for the sake of relevance, readability, understandability and usability by and for engineers.Instead, it tries to make re-use of existing identifiers for classes and properties by re-using all or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology.These statements have been extracted in different ways, e.g. by using Protégé tools importing an ontology and copying axioms of relevant items to Metadata4Ing or by download from data services or raw files of ontologies and manual copypasting.In some cases there was a need to extend or modify the original set of statements about an entity, e.g. because labels and definitions were expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of Metadata4Ing, or because a skos:preflabel or a skos:definition in any of the languages we would like to support was missing.Any editorial changes on elements from external ontologies are declared in Metadata4Ing by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level.To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item.Metadata4Ing reuses elements from the following ontologies:- BIBO = Bibliographic Ontology - BIRO = Bibliographic Reference Ontology - DCAT = Data Catalog - DCC = Digital Calibration Certificate - DCTERMS = Dublin Core Terms - EMMO = European Materials and Modelling Ontology - FOAF = Friend of a Friend - OBO = Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies: - BFO = Basic Formal Ontology - RO = Relation Ontology - OWL = Web Ontology Language - PIMS-II = PIMS Interoperability Infrastructure - PROV = Provenance Namespace - QUDT = Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types - RDF = Resource Description Framework - RDFS = RDF Schema - SCHEMA = schema.org - D-SI = Digital System of Units - SKOS = Simple Knowledge Organization System - SSN = Semantic Sensor Network Ontology - VANN = Vocabulary for Annotating vocabulary descriptions - XSD = XML Schema Definition","Metadata4Ing Workgroup","Ashish Karmacharya (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2822-7648), Technische Universität Darmstadt (https://ror.org/05n911h24, https://isni.org/isni/0000000109401669),Benjamin Farnbacher (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1489-6501), Technische Universität München (TUM) (https://ror.org/02kkvpp62, https://isni.org/isni/0000000123222966),Cord Wiljes (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2528-5391), Universität Bielefeld (https://ror.org/02hpadn98, https://isni.org/isni/0000000109449128),Dorothea Iglezakis (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8524-0569), Universität Stuttgart (https://ror.org/04vnq7t77, https://isni.org/isni/0000000419369713),Džulia Terzijska (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1698-6826), Technische Universität Braunschweig (TUBS) (https://ror.org/010nsgg66, https://isni.org/isni/0000000110900254),Giacomo Lanza (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2239-3955), Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) (https://ror.org/05r3f7h03, https://isni.org/isni/0000000121861887),Johanna Hickmann (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7535-8344), Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) (https://ror.org/05r3f7h03, https://isni.org/isni/0000000121861887),Johannes Munke (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5031-9170), Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) (https://ror.org/05558nw16, https://isni.org/isni/0000000123369749),Johannes Theissen-Lipp (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2639-1949), RWTH Aachen University (https://ror.org/04xfq0f34, https://isni.org/isni/0000000121811804),Jürgen Windeck (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1909-4353), Technische Universität Darmstadt (https://ror.org/05n911h24, https://isni.org/isni/0000000109401669),Martin Thomas Horsch (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9464-6739), Norges miljø- og biovitenskapelige universitet (NMBU) (https://ror.org/04a1mvv97, https://isni.org/isni/000000040607975X),Nils Hoppe (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0580-9717), Technische Universität München (TUM) (https://ror.org/02kkvpp62, https://isni.org/isni/0000000123222966),Sophia Leimer (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6272-204X), Universität Duisburg-Essen (https://ror.org/04mz5ra38, https://isni.org/isni/0000000121875445),Stephan Hachinger (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8341-1478), Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) (https://ror.org/05558nw16, https://isni.org/isni/0000000123369749),Susanne Arndt (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1019-9151), Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) (https://ror.org/04aj4c181, https://isni.org/isni/0000000121746694)","","https://nfdi4ing.pages.rwth-aachen.de/metadata4ing/metadata4ing/","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/m4i/versions/2023-09-27.n3","","","","2023-09-27","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"NLP Interchange Format","http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#","For a more concise description about NIF, we refer the reader to the ISWC 2013 in Use paper: Integrating NLP using Linked Data by Sebastian Hellmann, Jens Lehmann, Sören Auer, and Martin Brümmer available at: http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2013/ISWC_NIF/public.pdf Also the NLP2RDF project page (http://nlp2rdf.org) provides more general documentation and pointers. The NIF 2.0 Core Ontology (http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#) provides classes and properties to describe the relations between substrings, text, documents by assigning URIs to strings. These URIs can then be used as subjects in RDF triples and therefore they can be annotated easily. The NIF 2.0 Core Specification defines how such URIs are created and used: http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/specification/core.html and it makes sense to read this document first, so you can understand the definitions in this ontology better. The main class in this ontology is nif:String, which is the class of all words over the alphabet of Unicode characters (sometimes called Σ∗). We built NIF upon the Unicode Normalization Form C, as this follows the recommendation of the RDF standard for rdf:Literal. Indices are to be counted in code units as is common in most programming language and SPARQL engines ( see 17.4.3.2 STRLEN and 17.4.3.3 SUBSTR on http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/). Each URI Scheme (nif:URIScheme) used to address strings is a subclass of nif:String and puts further restrictions over the syntax of the URIs. For example, instances of type nif:RFC5147String have to adhere to the Syntax and Semantics of RFC 5147 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5147). Users of NIF can create their own URI schemes by subclassing nif:String and providing documentation on the Web in the rdfs:comment field. Another important subclass of nif:String is the nif:Context OWL class. This class is assigned to the whole string of the text (i.e. all characters). The purpose of an individual of this class is special, because the string of this individual is used to calculate the indices for all substrings. Therefore, all substrings have to have a relation nif:referenceContext pointing to an instance of nif:Context. Furthermore, the datatype property nif:isString can be used to include the reference text as a literal within the RDF as is required for the web service scenario. An example of NIF Core can be seen on the top left of the example Figure. Ontology models This ontology is split in different complimentary parts: * a terminological model (containing rdfs:comment, rdfs:label, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:range and rdfs:domain statements) * an inference model (containing owl:TransitiveProperty, owl:hasKey), see nif-core-inf.ttl * a validation model (containing owl:FunctionalProperty, owl:DisjointWith), see nif-core-val.ttl * a Stanford profile model (containing a more complex structure) An overview is given at the bottom of: http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ Feedback If you d like to leave feedback, please open an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/NLP2RDF/ontologies/issues) and read the README (https://github.com/NLP2RDF/ontologies#readme) or write an email to the mailing list: http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/nlp2rdf Versioning process is explained here: http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/specification/version.html Changelog is written to rdfs:comment (resource level versioning).The NLP Interchange Format (NIF) is an RDF/OWL-based format that aims to achieve interoperability between Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, language resources and annotations. NIF consists of specifications, ontologies and software, which are combined under the version identifier 2.0 , but are versioned individually. This ontology is developed by the NLP2RDF project (http://nlp2rdf.org) and provided as part of NIF 2.0 under CC-BY license as well as Apache 2.0.

This unique ontology has the potential to change this picture overnight.OntoAvida was initially developed by https://fortunalab.org, the computational biology lab at the Doñana Biological Station (a research institute of the Spanish National Research Council based at Seville, Spain).

"Ontology Modeling for Intelligent Domotic Environments","http://elite.polito.it/ontologies/dogont.owl","DogOnt is a novel modeling language for IDEs (Intelligent Domotic Environment), based on Semantic Web technologies. By adopting well known representations such as ontologies and by providing suitable reasoning facilities, DogOnt is able to face interoperation issues allowing to describe:- where a domotic device is located;- the set of capabilities of a domotic device;- the technology-specific features needed to interface the device;- the possible configurations that the device can assume;- how the home environment is composed;- what kind of architectural elements and furniture are placed inside the home.This information can then be leveraged by inference-based intelligent systems to provide advanced functionality required in Intelligent Domotic Environments. DogOnt is composed of two elements: the DogOnt ontology, expressed in OWL, which allows to formalize all the aspects of a IDE, and the DogOnt rules, which ease the modeling process by automatically generating proper states and functionalities for domotic devices, and by automatically associating them to the corresponding device instances through semantic relationships. DogOnt is currently adopted to provide house modeling and reasoning capabilities to a domotic gateway called DOG (Domotic OSGi Gateway), which is under development in the authors’ research group and that will be distributed as open source toolkit for building IDEs running on low cost PCs. In this context, a third component of DogOnt, namely DogOnt queries, not presented in this paper, supports runtime control of the IDE.","Dario Bonino (dario.bonino@polito.it, dario.bonino@gmail.com)","Luigi De Russis (luigi.derussis@polito.it, luigidr@gmail.com)","","http://iot-ontologies.github.io/dogont/","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/dogont/versions/2015-01-11.n3","","","","2014-09-24","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: disease , disorder , disease course , diagnosis , patient , and healthcare provider . OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to address some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas, TX) and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy).

"Ontopic Ontology","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl","An ontology of topics as used in thesauri, subject directories, etc.Topic is classified as a subclass of Collection, since its extensional semantics can be intended as a set of social objects (e.g. texts, concepts, other collections, relational meanings, etc.). Its intensional semantics is intended as an area of knowledge (or culture).The ontology is partly based on Chris Welty s formal ontology of subjects (DKE, 1999). Subtopic, near, and far relations are pretty similar to the ones defined there. The main differences are:- topics are intended here as collections of social objects, not as regions; there is anyway a morphism to the mereo-topological notion of Welty s, since for each topic as a collection we can define a topic space (a subclass of dul:Region) that corresponds to Welty s topics;- subjects in Welty s ontology, which are points in a topic region, are intended here in two ways:(1) as a dul:SocialObject that hasTopic a Topic. A dul:SocialObject in this case contains references to any entity that (in Welty s terms) is about a topic(2) as a Subject, which is characterized here as a subclass of Topic, which isTopicOf exactly 1 dul:SocialObjectFor example, in Welty s theory, given a football event, there can be a subject for that event that is a point in the space of a topic, e.g. football . In this ontology, this is represented as a dul:Event (the actual football event) that dul:isReferenceOf some dul:InformationObject (e.g. a report or article about the football event); such information object hasTopic a Topic (e.g. football). Therefore, this solution has specific counterparts to Welty s theory, although the intuition is very different: Welty s topics correspond here to Topic(s), Welty s subjects correspond here to parts of Topic(s), and Welty s individual entities in a domain ontology correspond here to any Entity that dul:isReferenceOf a dul:InformationObject that dul:expresses a dul:SocialObject that hasTopic a Topic.On the other hand, a geometrical conception of topics, for example the one assumed by LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis), might take advantage from the addition of topic spaces into the ontology, because one could use dimensional space operators, as well as take input and produce outputs into an ontology by reasoning over topic spaces.For this reason, in this version of the ontopic ontology, we also provide the classes TopicSpace and SubjectSpace, and link them to Topic(s) through the relation dul:isRegionFor; the advantage is that we have a dual encoding of topics, which get either a commonsensical semantics as collections of documents, notions, or any other dul:SocialObject, or a mereotopological semantics as dul:Region(s). The second semantics can be used jointly with LSA geometrical semantics.

"Open Provenance Model","http://openprovenance.org/model/opmo","The Open Provenance Model is a model of provenance that is designed to meet the following requirements: (1) To allow provenance information to be exchanged between systems, by means of a compatibility layer based on a shared provenance model. (2) To allow developers to build and share tools that operate on such a provenance model. (3) To define provenance in a precise, technology-agnostic manner. (4) To support a digital representation of provenance for any thing , whether produced by computer systems or not. (5) To allow multiple levels of description to coexist. (6) To define a core set of rules that identify the valid inferences that can be made on provenance representation.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/opmo/versions/2015-01-11.n3","","","","2010-10-13","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"
"Open Provenance Model Vocabulary","http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns#","OPMV, the Open Provenance Model Vocabulary, is a lightweight provenance vocabulary aiming to provide terms to enable practitioners of data publishing to publish their data responsibly. The Open Provenance Model Vocabulary is closely based on the community provenance data model, the Open Provenance Model (OPM) [Moreau09]. Since release 1.0 OPMV becomes a profile of OPM. OPMV can be used together with other provenance-related RDF/OWL vocabularies/ontologies, such as Dublin Core, FOAF, the Changeset Vocabulary, and the Provenance Vocabulary. As being grounded on OPM, the OPMV aims to assist the interoperability between provenance information on the Semantic Web. The Open Provenance Model Vocabulary is defined as an OWL-DL ontology and it is partitioned into a core ontology and supplementary modules. In order to avoid making the core ontology too complex, the core module only implements structures defined in OPM and the supplementary modules provide less frequently used terms and a broad range of specializations of the core terms.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/opmv/versions/2010-10-06.n3","","","","2010-10-06","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Orthology Ontology","http://purl.org/net/orth","The need of a common ontology for describing orthology information in biological research communities has led to the creation of the Orthology Ontology (ORTH). ORTH ontology is designed to describe sequence homology data available in multiple orthology databases on the Web (e.g.: OMA, OrthoDB, HieranoiDB, and etc.). By sequence homology data, we mostly mean gene region, gene and protein-centric orthology, paralogy, and xenology information. Depending on the database, the homology information is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology accommodates these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG), cluster of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences. In addition to the specific ORTH terms, this specification includes terms of the imported ontologies (e.g. Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, SIO) which are pertinent to represent the information from various orthology databases in a homogeneous way.","","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=http://purl.org/net/orth","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fnet%2Forth&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fnet%2Forth&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fnet%2Forth&f=ttl","2020-05-07","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

PAULA (and POWLA) implements the data model of the Linguistic Annotation Framework as described by Ide and Romary (2004).

"PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology","http://purl.org/spar/pro/","PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL for the characterization of the roles of agents (people, corporate bodies and computational agents) in the publication process. It permits one to specify how an agent has a role relating to a contextual entity, and the period of time during which that role is held.It is based on the Time-indexed Value in Context (TVC) ontology pattern (http://purl.org/spar/tvc).It is easy to extend the set of specified roles, simply by adding new individuals to the class pro:PublishingRole.This ontology is imported into SCoRO, the Scholarly Contribution and Roles Ontology (http://purl.org/spar/scoro/), where it is used similarly to enable the description of a wider range of contributions and roles relating to other scholarly activities and entities, including academic administration, funded projects, research investigations, data and authorship, and to define their temporal extents and contexts, as for publishing roles in PRO. Since roles have contexts and times that are important to take into account (for example, a person can be author of one paper and reviewer of another, while another person will be editor of a journal only for a defined period, not for ever), the PRO ontology permit these contexts to be specified, using an ontological design pattern called the time-indexed value in context (TVC) (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc/) which is imported into PRO. This ontology design pattern permits one to construct the following RDF statements: foaf:Agent pro:holdsRoleInTime [ a pro:RoleInTime pro:withRole pro:editor ] .Thus the domain of pro:withRole is not foaf:Agent, but rather an anonymous member of the class pro:RoleInTime, which itself is the range of the property pro:holdsRoleInTime, for which the domain is foaf:Agent. The range of pro:withRole is the class pro:Role, whose members permit specific roles to be specified. This single step of indirection permits other contextual and temporal attributes (not shown here) to be specified for this member of the class pro:RoleInTime, putting that role into context.Exemplar usage: foaf:Agent pro:holdsRoleInTime [ a pro:RoleInTime pro:withRole pro:editor ] .The Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO) is an ontology for the characterisation of the roles of agents â€“ people, corporate bodies and computational agents in the publication process. These agents can be, e.g. authors, editors, reviewers, publishers or librarians.**URL:** http://purl.org/spar/pro**Creators**: [David Shotton](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5506-523X), [Silvio Peroni](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-4305)**License:** [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)**Website:** http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/pro**Cite as:** Peroni, S., Shotton, D., Vitali, F.

"Performance Summary Display Ontology","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/psdo.owl","Performance Summary Display Ontology (PSDO) is an application ontology about motivating information in performance summaries and the visual and textual entities that are used to communicate about performance. Motivating information includes performance comparisons and changes that motivate improvement or sustainment, such as improvement towards a goal, loss of high performer status, or the presence of a performance gap. Visual and textual entities include charts, tables, and graphs that display performance information. PSDO s domain focus is healthcare organizations that use clinical quality dashboards and feedback interventions for healthcare professionals and teams. Performance information is commonly about the quality of care and health outcomes that have been derived from clinical data using performance measures (aka metrics, process indicators, quality measures, etc). PSDO uses Basic Formal Ontology as its upper level ontology.

"Platform Material Digital Core Ontology (PMDco)","https://w3id.org/pmd/co","The PMD Core Ontology (PMDco) is a comprehensive framework for representing knowledge that encompasses fundamental concepts from the domains of materials science and engineering (MSE). The PMDco has been designed as a mid-level ontology to establish a connection between specific MSE application ontologies and the domain neutral concepts found in established top-level ontologies. The primary goal of the PMDco is to promote interoperability between diverse domains. PMDco s class structure is both understandable and extensible, making it an efficient tool for organizing MSE knowledge. It serves as a semantic intermediate layer that unifies MSE knowledge representations, enabling data and metadata to be systematically integrated on key terms within the MSE domain. With PMDco, it is possible to seamlessly trace data generation. The design of PMDco is based on the W3C Provenance Ontology (PROV-O), which provides a standard framework for capturing the generation, derivation, and attribution of resources. By building on this foundation, PMDco facilitates the integration of data from various sources and the creation of complex workflows. In summary, PMDco is a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the MSE domains. It provides a common language for representing and sharing knowledge, allowing for efficient collaboration and promoting interoperability between diverse domains. Its design allows for the systematic integration of data and metadata, enabling seamless traceability of data generation. Overall, PMDco is a crucial step towards a unified and comprehensive understanding of the MSE domain.

"Predicate Model for Ontologies (PreMOn) - Core ontology module","http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core","### Semantic Classes and RolesThe *PreMOn Ontology Core Module* extends *lemon* by introducing classes [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) and [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole). [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) homogeneously represents the semantic classes from the various predicate models. That is, individuals of this class correspond to rolesets in PB and NB (e.g., *pm:nb10-seller.01* and *pm:pb17-sell.01*), verb classes in VN (e.g., *pm:vn32-give-13.1-1*), and frames in FN (e.g., *pm:fn15-commerce sell*). An instance of [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) typically has (via property [pmo:semRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#semRole)) a number of [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole)s, representing, from a semantic point of view, the roles the arguments of that [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) can play.Semantic roles are defined locally to semantic classes, so VN *agent* is represented as multiple semantic roles, one for each verb class it occurs in, and with each semantic role linked to its specific selectional restrictions (if any). Note that [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) is defined as subclass of [ontolex:LexicalConcept](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Concept), as we see [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass)es as essentially informal concepts rather than well defined concepts of a formal ontology (although an ontology can be derived from them, cf., FrameBase and ESO). In particular, being [ontolex:LexicalConcept](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Concept)s, [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass)es inherit the link to lexical entries.Properties [pmo:classRel](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#classRel) and [pmo:roleRel](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#roleRel), and their resource-specific subproperties, are introduced to express the relations between elements at each level, such as subtyping, and predicate and role inheritance (e.g., [pmofn:inheritsFrom](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#inheritsFrom) and [pmofn:inheritsFromFER](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#inheritsFromFER) for FN). Additional resource-specific classes (e.g., [pmovn:ThematicRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#ThematicRole)) and properties (e.g., [pmovn:thematicRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#thematicRole)) further characterize important aspects of each predicate model, like commonalities between semantic roles.### MappingsMappings between different predicate models are practically relevant but cannot be expressed using only the classes above, as they are often defined (e.g., in SemLink and PredicateMatrix) in terms of pairs. To model these pairs, one could reuse the notion of ontolex:LexicalSense. However, its formalization in lemon as reified relation depends on the existence of (exactly) one ontological entity for each pair, a strong constraint that we do not necessarily need for our purposes. Therefore, we introduce the [pmo:Conceptualization](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Conceptualization) class. Structurally, a [pmo:Conceptualization](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Conceptualization) can be seen as the reification of the [ontolex:evokes](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Evokes) relation between [ontolex:LexicalEntry](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Entry) and [ontolex:LexicalConcept](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Concept). Semantically, it can be seen as a very specific intensional concept (among many, in case of polysemy) evoked by a single [ontolex:LexicalEntry](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Entry), which can be generalized to a [ontolex:LexicalConcept](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Concept) when multiple entries are considered but with a possible loss of information that prevents precise alignments to be represented.Mappings are explicitly represented as individuals of class [pmo:Mapping](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Mapping), and can be seen as sets of (or n-ary relations between) either (i) [pmo:Conceptualization](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Conceptualization)s, (ii) [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass)es, and (iii) [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole)s, with role mappings anchored to conceptualization or class mappings via property [pmo:semRoleMapping](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#semRoleMapping). We rely on this set-like modeling, since mappings are not necessarily represented as binary relations in predicate mapping resources: e.g., in the PredicateMatrix, each row represents the mapping of a semantic role / lexical entry pair over the different resources (e.g., in VN, in PB, in FN) as well as the corresponding WordNet verb sense. Reifying the n-ary mapping relation also allows us, if needed, to further characterize each single mapping, asserting additional information such as confidence and reliability. Moreover, it is possible to further specialize mappings(e.g., to model mappings holding only in one direction, from a resource to another one, or to represent different types of relationships among the members of the mapping) by subtyping the [pmo:Mapping](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Mapping) class or the property (pmo:item) relating a [pmo:Mapping](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Mapping) to its members.### Ontological MappingsBuilding on *lemon*, *PreMOn* inherits the capability of linking lexical content to ontological resources. In particular, being [ontolex:LexicalConcept](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Concept)s, [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass)es inherit the link (via [ontolex:isConceptOf](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Concept)) to the ontological entities formalizing them, typically event classes.However, in order to properly align predicate models to existing frame/event-based ontologies such as FrameBase and ESO, *PreMOn* introduces the property [pmo:ontologyMatch](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#ontologyMatch), having as domain [skos:Concept](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept), to enable the possibility of linking to ontological entities also other resources than [ontolex:LexicalConcept](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Concept)s. In particular, [pmo:ontologyMatch](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#ontologyMatch) property enables the alignment to ontology elements of resources such as: * [pmo:Conceptualization](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Conceptualization)s* [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass)es (in this case, [ontolex:isConceptOf](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Concept) can be seen as a subproperty of [pmo:ontologyMatch](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#ontologyMatch), although we abstained from formally enforcing this)* [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole)s.### AnnotationsPredicate models are typically complemented by examples showing concrete occurrences of semantic classes and roles in text. More generally, a text can be annotated with semantic classes and roles as a result of manual or automatic SRL.The PreMOn Ontology provides some common primitives, based on the [NLP Interchange Format](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core/nif-core.html) (NIF) by Hellmann et al. (2013), which aim at properly modeling the heterogeneous annotations of a text for different predicate models. NIF introduces the general notion of [nif:String](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#String) to represent arbitrary text strings. [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context) is a particular subclass of [nif:String](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#String), representing a whole string of text. Any substring (itself a [nif:String](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#String)) has a [nif:referenceContext](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#referenceContext) relation to the [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context) individual representing the whole text containing it.To specifically model the aforementioned examples complementing predicate models, we introduce [pmo:Example](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Example), subclass of [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context), to represent the string associated with the example. The occurrence of a [ontolex:LexicalEntry](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Entry), [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass), or [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole) in a [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context) is denoted by an instance of [nif:Annotation](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Annotation), related to the given [ontolex:LexicalEntry](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Entry), [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass), or [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole) via property [pmo:valueObj](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#valueObj) (the value attached to the annotation), and to the [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context) instance via property [nif:annotation](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#annotation). If detailed information on the specific span of text (i.e., substring) denoting the [ontolex:LexicalEntry](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Entry), [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass), or [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole) is available (e.g., FN provides the specific offsets of lexical units, frames, and frame elements, in the example text) an additional instance of [pmo:Markable](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Markable), subclass of [nif:String](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#String), is created and linked to the specific [nif:Annotation](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Annotation) and [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context) via properties [nif:annotation](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#annotation) and [nif:referenceContext](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#referenceContext), respectively. As the same [nif:Context](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Context) may contain multiple [nif:Annotation](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#Annotation)s referring to one or more semantic classes and their corresponding roles, an additional [pmo:AnnotationSet](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#AnnotationSet) instance is created to cluster annotations from the same predicate structure.The [PreMOn Ontology](http://premon.fbk.eu) is an extension of [lemon](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification) (W3C Ontology Lexicon Community Group, 2015) for representing *predicate models* and their *mappings*. The Core Module of the PreMOn Ontology defines the main abstractions for modelling *semantic classes* with their *semantic roles*, *mappings* between different predicate models, and *annotations*.","Francesco Corcoglioniti,Marco Rospocher","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpremon.fbk.eu%2Fontology%2Fcore&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpremon.fbk.eu%2Fontology%2Fcore&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpremon.fbk.eu%2Fontology%2Fcore&f=ttl","2018-02-15","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"
"Predicate Model for Ontologies (PreMOn) - FrameNet ontology module","http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn","The PreMOn FrameNet ontology module defines classes [pmofn:Frame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#Frame) and [pmofn:FrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FrameElement) as subclasses of [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) and [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole), respectively. [pmofn:FrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FrameElement) is further specialized in four subclasses, denoting the four typologies of FN frame elements (e.g., [pmofn:CoreFrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#CoreFrameElement)). Being [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole)s, in PreMOn Ontology frame elements are always specific to the frame where they are defined, even for extra thematic frame elements that are typically shared across frames in FN (e.g., the *Circumstances* extra thematic frame element corresponds to multiple individuals of type [pmofn:ExtraThematicFrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#ExtraThematicFrameElement), one for each frame where it is defined). Frame element core sets of a [pmofn:Frame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#Frame) are represented as reified objects of type [pmofn:FECoreSet](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FECoreSet), having as members some [pmofn:FrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FrameElement)s.Relations between [pmofn:Frame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#Frame)s are modeled using the subproperties of [pmofn:frameRelation](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#frameRelation) (e.g., [pmofn:inheritsFrom](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#inheritsFrom)). Similarly, mappings between [pmofn:FrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FrameElement)s of [pmofn:Frame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#Frame)s related via some [pmofn:frameRelation](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#frameRelation) are represented using frame relation-specific subproperties of [pmofn:frameElementRelation](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#frameElementRelation) (e.g., [pmofn:inheritsFromFER](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#inheritsFromFER)). Within a frame, a frame element may exclude/require the presence of another frame element ([pmofn:excludesFrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#excludesFrameElement)/[pmofn:requiresFrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#requiresFrameElement)). [pmofn:LexicalUnit](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#LexicalUnit), associating a lexical entry with a frame, is defined as subclass of [pmo:Conceptualization](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Conceptualization). A [pmofn:LexicalUnit](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#LexicalUnit) may have a development status ([pmofn:LUStatus](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#LUStatus)) and can incorporate a [pmofn:FrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FrameElement) (e.g., *microvawe.v*, besides evoking frame *Apply heat*, also incorporates the frame element *Heating instrument*).Finally, [pmofn:Frame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#Frame)s, [pmofn:FrameElement](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#FrameElement)s and [pmofn:LexicalUnit](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#LexicalUnit)s can be constrained according to some semantic types, defined in [pmofn:SemType](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#SemType), and organized in a hierarchy according to [pmofn:subTypeOf](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/fn#subTypeOf) relations between them.The FrameNet module of the PreMOn ontology extends the core module for representing concepts specific to FrameNet. The modelling is based on the [FrameNet II: Extended Theory and Practice](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/docs/r1.5/book.pdf) book.","Marco Rospocher ,Francesco Corcoglioniti","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/pmofn/versions/2017-08-23.n3","","","","2017-05-01","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Predicate Model for Ontologies (PreMOn) - VerbNet ontology module","http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn","The VerbNet module of the PreMOn ontology defines classes [pmovn:VerbClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#VerbClass) and [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole) as subclasses of [pmo:SemanticClass](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticClass) and [pmo:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SemanticRole), respectively. *Class members* are modeled as instances of [ontolex:LexicalEntry](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Lexical_Entry), connected to their class via property [ontolex:evokes](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification#Evokes). The VN class hierarchy is modeled via the [pmovn:subclassOf](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#subclassOf) property (subproperty of [skos:broader](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#broader)), that relates a verb class (e.g., *13.1-1*) with its parent class (e.g., *13.1*). Given the propagation of semantic roles along the class hierarchy, we introduce property [pmovn:definesSemRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#definesSemRole) to differentiate the [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole) instances defined on a class from the ones inherited from its ancestor classes. Each [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole) instance is related (via property [pmovn:thematicRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#thematicRole)) to exactly one pmovn:ThematicRole, which contains all the thematic roles defined in VB. These thematic roles are organized in a hierarchy, which is formalized via the skos:broader property. VN selectional restrictions on [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole)s (e.g., restricting *theme* to something not animate) are formalized using property [pmovn:restriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#restriction) and class [pmovn:Restriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#Restriction) (see later).A verb class may have one or more [pmovn:VerbNetFrame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#VerbNetFrame)s (via property [pmovn:frame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#frame), or its subproperty [pmovn:definesFrame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#definesFrame), to distinguish frames defined on the class or inherited from ancestors), which have:* one or more ordered [pmo:SynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SynItem)s, modeling a syntactic construction (e.g., *Agent V Theme [-sentential]*) shared by all members of the class. [pmo:SynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#SynItem)s are specialized according to their syntactical function (e.g., [pmovn:NpSynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#NpSynItem) for noun phrases). A [pmovn:NpSynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#NpSynItem) can point (via [pmo:valueObj](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#valueObj)) to a [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole), and define, via [pmovn:restriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#restriction), (i) a selectional restriction holding for the [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole) in that frame (e.g., *animate*), or (ii) some other syntactic restriction (e.g., *np to inf*). Similarly, selectional restrictions can be modelled on [pmovn:PrepSynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PrepSynItem) (e.g., *spatial*);* one or more ordered semantic [pmo:Pred](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Pred)s, modeling the meaning of the event, and its participants, expressed by the verb class for that syntactic construction (e.g.,*approve(during(E), Agent, Theme)*). Predicates in [pmovn:Pred](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#Pred) have a type ([pmovn:PredType](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PredType), e.g., *approve*) and can be further decomposed in [pmovn:PredArg](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PredArg) (e.g., *during(E)*) of various types (e.g., [pmovn:EventPredArg](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#EventPredArg)). Negation of a predicate is expressed by typing the corresponding instance as [pmovn:NegPred](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#NegPred), while implicit [pmovn:PredArg](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PredArg)s are typed as [pmovn:ImplicitPredArg](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#ImplicitPredArg).A [pmovn:VerbNetFrame](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#VerbNetFrame) is directly associated to its corresponding [pmo:Example](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/core#Example) via the pmovn:frameExample property.### Restrictions[pmovn:Restriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#Restriction)s are modeled structurally as AND / OR compositions ([pmovn:CompoundRestriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#CompoundRestriction) and subclasses) of atomic restrictions ([pmovn:AtomicRestriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#AtomicRestriction) and subclasses) that require the presence or absence of a certain [pmovn:RestrictionProperty](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#RestrictionProperty). Semantically, restrictions are divided in [pmovn:SyntacticRestriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SyntacticRestriction)s, which refer to a [pmovn:SyntacticRestrictionProperty](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SyntacticRestrictionProperty) and are attached to [pmovn:NpSynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#NpSynItem)s, and [pmovn:SelectionalRestriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SelectionalRestriction)s. The latter are divided in [pmovn:PrepositionalSelectionalRestriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PrepositionalSelectionalRestriction)s, which refer to a [pmovn:PrepositionalRestrictionProperty](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PrepositionalRestrictionProperty) and are attached to [pmovn:PrepSynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#PrepSynItem)s, and [pmovn:RoleSelectionalRestriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#RoleSelectionalRestriction)s, which refer to a [pmovn:RoleRestrictionProperty](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#RoleRestrictionProperty) and are attached both to [pmovn:SemanticRole](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#SemanticRole)s and [pmovn:NpSynItem](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#NpSynItem)s. Every restriction instance instantiates both a structural and a semantic subclass of [pmovn:Restriction](http://premon.fbk.eu/ontology/vn#Restriction).The VerbNet module of the PreMOn ontology extends the core module with classes and properties specific to the VerbNet predicate model.

"Process Execution ontology.","https://w3id.org/pep/","The process execution ontology is a proposal for a simple extension of both the [W3C Semantic Sensor Network](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) and the [Semantic Actuator Network](https://www.irit.fr/recherches/MELODI/ontologies/SAN.owl) ontology cores. SSN describe `ssn:Sensor`s that implement `ssn:Sensing` methods and generate `ssn:Observation`s, which are (soon to be) activities.In parallel to this, SAN describes `san:Actuator`s that implement `san:Acting` methods and generate `ssn:Actuation` activities.In this ontology, we want to generalize these two parallel conceptual models, and account for a third use case: *Web services exposed on the web may trigger the execution of some processes*. We hence propose the following core concepts for the Process Execution ontology:> `pep:ProcessExecutor`s implement `pep:Process` methods, and generate `pep:ProcessExecution`s activities._Note: we call for comments and suggestions about the naming of these concepts [in this project open issue](https://github.com/thesmartenergy/pep/issues/1)_As sensing and acting methods in SSN and SAN, processes may describe the necessary inputs and outputs. This is represented using properties `pep:hasInput` and `pep:hasOutput`. These properties may also be used to describe the actual input and output of a specific process execution.Figure below overviews the PEP ontology, and illustrates it with an example.[![Overview of the PEP Ontology](https://w3id.org/pep/pep.png)](https://w3id.org/pep/pep.png).Additional documents describe alignments with other existing ontologies:- [the Semantic Sensor Network ontology](https://w3id.org/pep/SSNAlignment);- [the RDF Presentation ontology](https://w3id.org/pep/RDFPAlignment).## Process Execution Platform[Process execution platforms](https://w3id.org/pep/platform.html) expose process executors on the Web in a RESTful way.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/pep/versions/2016-07-01.n3","","","","2016-09-12","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

This ontology reflects: 1) The basic hierarchy of a company: Group (Company), Divisions of a Group, Brand names attached to a Division or a Group, and 2) The production of a company: products, ranges of products (attached to a Brand), the composition of a product, packages of products...What contributions ? - pv:RangeIn ProVoc we introduce pv:Range.GoodRelations defined variants ( http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants , http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf ) as following: A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in a few properties. According to GoodRelations, a variant of a MacBook is for example a MacBook13Inch or MacBook15Inch which vary in screen size and in available USB ports. This is inheritage between a product model and its derivatives, which must meet the standards imposed by the product model (obviously values can be redefined locally). According to the current version of GoodRelations,gr:isVariantOf necessarily exists between two models of product or service. However, ranges of products can hardly be considered as a set of derivatives of a product (or model of product). For example, Elsève is a range of products offering shampoos with some derivatives, but Elsève also offers creams with derivatives, oils with derivatives etc., so apart that such products are related to treatment for hair, they have not much in common. Using gr:isVariantOf between certain close products, we would obtain multiple clusters of related products, to the detriment of a unique range of products. Using pv:Range allows to respect the structure provided by the expert.In conclusion, variants seem to identify similar products (see also http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo which differs from gr:isVariantOf by the fact that the domain and ranks of isSimilarTo are larger), but pv:range has a different vocation.gr:isVariantOf has a very broad and subjective semantics (such as gr:isSimilarTo, as Mr. Hepp said clearly here http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo ). For example , with gr:isVariantOf it would be possible to express that a Renault Clio 4 is a variant of a Ford Fiesta ( http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ yet they are not of the same brand) whilst they are not of the same brand name.Finally, note that a pv:Range does not represent a set of products nor product models. pv:range is used to objectively link a brand to its products (provided by the expert).It would be appropriate to limit the use of gr:isVariantOf to products belonging to a pv:Range.- pv:PackageIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Package class that is used to represent sets of products sold as a single product. For example a cosmetic box containing a BB cream, a lip gloss, and a perfume byl Lancôme. Another example is a food package that contains different products.- pv:ProviderIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Provider that makes a product available in the e-commerce.- pv:ComponentIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Component which enables to describe the composition of a product (for instance, a perfume can contain linalool).We introduce more properties and classes in order to refine the model. For instance, pv:Model, pv:Designer, and pv:Ambassador appear as a subclass of foaf:Person. ProVoc can also be used in order to link products and their components with their impact on health ( see pv:healthImpact).Concerning classic properties related to the product, such as color, price, reference, description, etc., see Good Relations (http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/).","","","Copyright © 2016 INRIA and VISEO","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/provoc/versions/2016-02-18.n3","","","","2016-02-18","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Provenance Vocabulary Core Ontology","http://purl.org/net/provenance/ns#","The Provenance Vocabulary provides classes and properties for describing provenance of Web data. The vocabulary focuses on two main use cases: 1.) It enables consumers of Web data to describe provenance of data retrieved from the Web and of data derived from such Web data. 2.) It enables providers of Web data to publish provenance-related metadata about their data. Notice, the vocabulary is not intended for describing provenance of other kinds of Web content. The Provenance Vocabulary is designed as a Web data specific specialization of the W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O); classes and properties provided by the vocabulary are domain specific extensions of the more general concepts introduced in PROV-O. As a consequence, any Provenance Vocabulary based description of provenance can be easily interpreted and exchanged according to the W3C PROV family of standards.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/prv/versions/2012-03-14.n3","","","","2012-03-14","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"Provenance, Authoring and Versioning","http://purl.org/pav/","PAV supplies terms for distinguishing between the different roles of the agents contributing content in current web based systems: contributors, authors, curators and digital artifact creators. The ontology also provides terms for tracking provenance of digital entities that are published on the web and then accessed, transformed and consumed. In order to support broader interoperability, PAV specializes the general purpose W3C PROV provenance model (PROV-O).PAV distinguishes between the data related to the digital artifact - named Provenance - and those related to the actual knowledge creation and therefore to the intellectual property aspects – named Authoring. The Versioning axis describes the evolution of digital entities in time.Using PAV, descriptions can define the authors that originate or gave existence to the work that is expressed in the digital resource (pav:authoredBy); curators (pav:curatedBy) who are content specialists responsible for shaping the expression in an appropriate format, and contributors (super-property pav:contributedBy) that provided some help in conceiving the resource or in the expressed knowledge creation/extraction.These provenance aspects can be detailed with dates using pav:curatedOn, pav:authoredOn, etc. Further details about the creation activities, such as different authors contributing specific parts of the resource at different dates are out of scope for PAV and should be defined using vocabularies like PROV-O and additional intermediate entities to describe the different states.For resources based on other resources, PAV allows specification of direct retrieval (pav:retrievedFrom), import through transformations (pav:importedFrom) and sources that were merely consulted (pav:sourceAccessedAt). These aspects can also define the agents responsible using pav:retrievedBy, pav:importedBy and pav:sourceAccessedBy.Version number of a resource can be given with pav:version, the previous version of the resource with pav:previousVersion, and any other earlier versions with pav:hasEarlierVersion. Unversioned, mutable resources can specify their current version as a snapshot resource using pav:hasCurrentVersion and list the earlier versions using pav:hasVersion.The creation of the digital representation (e.g. an RDF graph or a .docx file) can in many cases be different from the authorship of the content/knowledge, and in PAV this digital creation is specified using pav:createdBy, pav:createdWith and pav:createdOn.PAV specializes terms from W3C PROV-O (prov:) and DC Terms (dcterms:), however these ontologies are not OWL imported as PAV can be used independently. The is defined by links indicate where those terms are included from. See http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o and http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/ for more details. See http://purl.org/pav/mapping/dcterms For a comprehensive SKOS mapping to DC Terms.PAV 2 is based on PAV 1.2 but in a different namespace ( http://purl.org/pav/ ). Terms compatible with 1.2 are indicated in this ontology using owl:equivalentProperty.The ontology IRI http://purl.org/pav/ always resolve to the latest version of PAV 2. Particular versionIRIs such as http://purl.org/pav/2.1 can be used by clients to force imports of a particular version - note however that all terms are defined directly in the http://purl.org/pav/ namespace.The goal of PAV is to provide a lightweight, straight forward way to give the essential information about authorship, provenance and versioning, and therefore these properties are described directly on the published resource. As such, PAV does not define any classes or restrict domain/ranges, as all properties are applicable to any online resource.--Copyright 2008-2014 Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Balboa Systems; University of ManchesterLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the License ); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

This ontology is partially based on the SysML QUDV (Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Values) proposed by a working group of the SysML 1.2 Revision Task Force (RTF), working in close coordination with the OMG MARTE specification group. This model library is specified in a UML/SysML class/block diagram in the OMG SysML, Version 1.2 specification (http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.2/). This model is described in OMG SysML, Version 1.2 Appendix C.4 Model Library for Quantity Kinds and Units (http://ontolog.cim3.net/file/resource/reference/UoM_Ontology_Standard/available-UoM-references/QUDV-Annex-C4-C5--OMG-SysML-v1-2_Oct-2009.pdf). The QUDV model has also been represented in the form of an ontology using a formal ontology definition language. The resulting OWL ontology, called the QUDV ontology http://www.omgwiki.org/OMGSysML/doku.php?id=sysml-qudv:qudv_owl has been published by members of the QUDV working group of the SysML 1.2 Revision Task Force (RTF). OMG SysML is a trademark of OMG (see http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.2/PDF/ for the conditions of use of the OMG SysML, Version 1.2 specification). In order to generalize its potential usage and alignment with other standardization efforts concerning quantities and units, the QU ontology has been further developed as a complement to the Agriculture Meteorology example showcasing the ontology developed by the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks incubator group (SSN-XG). The Agriculture Meteorology example also includes an application of the QU schema to the UN/CEFACT Recommendation 20 code list. For more information on the group s activities see: http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ . Please report any errors to the Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Activity via the public W3C list public-xg-ssn@w3.org or alternatively, for enquiries about the QUDV model, to the QUDV mailing list: http://www.omg.org/publicarchives/qudv/ The QUDV copyright holders have agreed for the QU ontology to be published by the W3C Semantic Sensor Incubator Group but this does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the QUDV working group of the SysML 1.2 Revision Task Force.

Clause 4.1 of the present document shortly introduces a high level view of the envisioned SAREF4EHAW semantic model and modular ontology, with the retained concepts (i.e. classes) and their relations. SAREF4EHAW extension has been specified and formalised by investigating EHAW domain related resources, as reported in ETSI TR 103 509, such as: potential stakeholders, standardization initiatives, alliances/associations, European projects, EC directives, existing ontologies, and data repositories. Therefore, SAREF4EHAW modular ontology shall both: - Allow the implementation of a limited set of typical EHAW related use cases already identified in ETSI TR 103 509, i.e. - Use case 1 “elderly at home monitoring and support”, - Use case 2 “monitoring and support of healthy lifestyles for citizens”, - Use case 3 “Early Warning System (EWS) and Cardiovascular Accidents detection”. - Fulfil the eHealth Ageing Well related requirements provided in ETSI TR 103 509, mainly the ontological ones that were mostly taken as input for the ontology specification.SAREF4EHAW mainly reuses the following existing ontologies: SAREF, ETSI SmartBAN reference model, SAREF 4 Environment extension and W3C SSN System module. The following figure presents the high level view of SAREF4EHAW ontology.![SAREF4SYST overview](diagrams/SAREF4EHAW_Model.jpg)For semantic interoperability handling purposes, an ontology based solution, combined with sensing-as-a-service and WoT strategies, is retained for SAREF4EHAW. Therefore, an upper level ontology, at service level, shall also behas been fully modelled (Service class and sub-classes depicted in the previous figure).For embedded semantic analytics purposes, SAREF4EHAW shall behas been designed using the modularity principle (see ETSI TR 103 509) and can thus be mainly described by the following self-contained knowledge sub-ontologies (or modules): HealthActor, Ban, HealthDevice, Function (measured data related concepts included) and Service.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/s4ehaw/versions/2020-05-01.n3","","","","2020-05-01","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"SAREF4SYST: an extension of SAREF for typology of systems and their inter-connections","https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/","The present document is the technical specification of SAREF4SYST, a generic extension of [ETSI TS 103 264 SAREF](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/02.01.01_60/ts_103264v020101p.pdf) that defines an ontology pattern which can be instantiated for different domains. SAREF4SYST defines Systems, Connections between systems, and Connection Points at which systems may be connected. These core concepts can be used generically to define the topology of features of interest, and can be specialized for multiple domains. The topology of features of interest is highly important in many use cases. If a room holds a lighting device, and if it is adjacent with an open window to a room whose luminosity is low, then by turning on the lighting device in the former room one may expect that the luminosity in the latter room will rise.The SAREF4SYST ontology pattern can be instantiated for different domains. For example to describe zones inside a building (systems), that share a frontier (connections). Properties of systems are typically state variables (e.g. agent population, temperature), whereas properties of connections are typically flows (e.g. heat flow).SAREF4SYST has two main aims: on the one hand, to extend SAREF with the capability or representing general topology of systems and how they are connected or interact and, on the other hand, to exemplify how ontology patterns may help to ensure an homogeneous structure of the overall SAREF ontology and speed up the development of extensions.SAREF4SYST consists both of a core ontology, and guidelines to create ontologies following the SAREF4SYST ontology pattern. The core ontology is a lightweight OWL-DL ontology that defines 3 classes and 9 object properties.Use cases for ontology patterns are described extensively in [ETSI TR 103 549 Clauses 4.2 and 4.3](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103549/01.01.01_60/tr_103549v010101p.pdf).For the Smart Energy domain:- Electric power systems can exchange electricity with other electric power systems. The electric energy can flow both ways in some cases (from the Public Grid to a Prosumer), or in only one way (from the Public Grid to a Load). Electric power systems can be made up of different sub-systems. Generic sub-types of electric power systems include producers, consumers, storage systems, transmission systems. - Electric power systems may be connected one to another through electrical connection points. An Electric power system may have multiple connection points (Multiple Winding Transformer generally have one single primary winding with two or more secondary windings). Generic sub-types of electrical connection points include plugs, sockets, direct-current, single-phase, three-phase, connection points. - An Electrical connection may exist between two Electric power systems at two of their respective connection points. Generic sub-types of electrical connections include Single-phase Buses, Three-phase Buses. A single-phase electric power system can be connected using different configurations at a three-phase bus (RN, SN, TN types).For the Smart Building domain:- Buildings, Storeys, Spaces, are different sub-types of Zones. Zones can contain sub-zones. Zones can be adjacent or intersect with other zones. - Two zones may share one or more connections. For example some fresh air may be created inside a storey if it has two controllable openings to the exterior at different cardinal points. A graphical overview of the SAREF4SYST ontology is provided in Figure 1. In such figure:- Rectangles are used to denote Classes. The label of the rectangle is the identifier of the Class.- Plain arrows are used to represent Object Properties between Classes. The label of the arrow is the identifier of the Object Property. The origin of the arrow is the domain Class of the property, and the target of the arrow is the range Class of the property.- Dashed arrows with identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e. `>` ) refer to OWL axioms that are applied to some property. Four pairs of properties are inverse one of the other; the property `s4syst:connectedTo` is symmetric, and properties `s4syst:hasSubSystem` and `s4syst:hasSubSystem` are transitive.- A symbol =1 near the target of an arrow denotes that the associated property is functional. A symbol ∃ denotes a local existential restriction.![SAREF4SYST overview](diagrams/overview.png)","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/s4syst/versions/2020-06-14.n3","","","","2020-06-14","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"SAREF: the Smart Appliances REFerence ontology","https://saref.etsi.org/core/","The Smart Applications REFerence ontology (SAREF) is intended to enable interoperability between solutions from different providers and among various activity sectors in the Internet of Things (IoT), thus contributing to the development of the global digital market.Information about changes compared to version 2.1.1: - Added the saref:FeatureOfInterest class and the properties used to relate it to saref:Measurement (saref:hasMeasurement and saref:isMeasurementOf) and to saref:Property (saref:hasProperty and saref:isPropertyOf). - Added the saref:measurementMadeBy property as inverse of saref:makesMeasurement. - The saref:relatesToProperty and saref:relatesToMeasurement properties are now inverse of each other. - The range of saref:hasValue, which was defined as xsd:float, has been removed to support other datatypes for measurements. - The range of datatype properties, which was defined as xsd:string, has been removed in order to support strings with language tags (rdf:langString). This affects saref:hasDescription, saref:hasManufacturer, saref:hasModel and saref:hasName, which now have implicitly a range of rdfs:Literal. - The saref:hasName property has been removed and the use of rdfs:label is recommended. - The saref:hasDescription property has been deprecated and the use of rdfs:comment is recommended. - Too restrictive restrictions have been removed and in some cases the ontology documentation has been updated to reflect this: a saref:Command having at most one saref:hasDescription; a saref:Task being accomplished by at least one saref:Device; a saref:Device having a typical consumption of only energy or power; a saref:Commodity being measured in units of measure; restrictions on the values of saref:accomplishes that only covered specific use cases; universal restrictions on the saref:actsUpon property have been changed to existential ones; restrictions on the commands that a saref:Function may have, since there could be others not included in the defined enumerations; restrictive documentation of saref:EventFunction and saref:SmokeSensor. - Bugs have been fixed: some devices (saref:DoorSwitch, saref:EnergyMeter, saref:LigthSwitch, saref:SmokeSensor, and saref:TemperatureSensor) were defined as subclass of a device and at the same time as consisting of such device; a saref:LightSwitch controls light and does not measure light, since it is an actuator; incorrect documentation of saref:OnState and saref:OffState. - The saref:BuildingRelated, saref:EnergyRelated and saref:FunctionRelated classes have been removed, since the different extensions already classify the device types. - The instances of the subclasses of saref:Command have been removed, since they represent examples. - The instances of saref:UnitOfMeasure have been moved to examples. - The classes related to the SAREF4ENER extension have been removed: saref:Generator, saref:Storage, saref:Load and saref:EnergyMeter. - Some instances of saref:Device have been moved to examples: saref:WashingMachine, saref:LightingDevice, saref:MicroRenewable, saref:Multimedia, and saref:Network. - Added domain and range axioms wherever the definition of a property unambiguously identifies the domain or the range of the property. - The OWL Time ontology is not imported anymore. - The documentation of some ontology terms has been updated for clarification. - Language tags have been added to all labels and comments. Information about changes compared to version 1.1.1: - The classes and properties related to how to represent devices in building spaces (such as the saref:BuildingSpace class, saref:BuildingObject class and saref:isLocatedIn property) have been removed from SAREF and incorporated into the SAREF4BLDG extension related to buildings, including the reuse of the W3C? WGS84 geo positioning vocabulary. - The saref:DeviceCategory and saref:FunctionCategory classes have been removed. Instead, the hierarchy of device categories has been implemented directly as subclasses of the saref:Device class. - The information specific for energy efficiency has been moved to the SAREF4ENER extension. For example, the saref:Profile class has been redefined to accommodate only the properties that are general enough for any type of profile, not only for energy and power. Details on how to specifically model a power profile can be found in the SAREF4ENER extension. - The subclasses of the saref:Energy class have been removed (i.e., Average Energy, Maximum Energy, Minimum Energy, Total Energy, HVAC Energy, Hot Water Energy and Lighting Energy). - The saref:Property class has been split into two classes (saref:Property and saref:Measurement), as it is done in the SAREF4ENVI extension, in order to properly accommodate the distinction between the concept of property (an observable quality of something) and the concept of measurement (a concrete value observed for a property). - Too restrictive cardinality restrictions have been revised, sometimes making them optional rather than mandatory (better to make properties mandatory in the extensions that specialize SAREF for a specific purpose, rather than restricting SAREF, whose purpose is more general). For example, definitions of units of measurement using an enumeration (owl:oneOf) were too restrictive because they did not allow using other units than those enumerated. Therefore, the individuals of each class are still there, but the owl:oneOf enumeration has been removed. - The saref:UnitOfMeasure subclasses use individuals from the OM ontology for unit of measures, but this is not the only solution. It has been clarified in the comments that the OM ontology is an example, but other ontologies can be used. - The global restrictions (rdfs:domain and rdfs:range) in object properties have been completely removed not to hinder interoperability. Object properties are now only restricted locally in the classes. - The subclasses of saref:Task have been transormed in individuals. - The saref:hasTask property has been removed from the saref:Profile class to resolve an ambiguity with the saref:Task class.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/saref/versions/2020-05-29.n3","","","","2020-05-29","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"
"SAREF: the Smart Appliances REFerence ontology","https://w3id.org/saref","The Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology is a shared model of consensus that facilitates the matching of existing assets (standards/protocols/datamodels/etc.) in the smart appliances domain. The SAREF ontology provides building blocks that allow separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology depending on specific needs. The starting point of SAREF is the concept of device (e.g., a switch). Devices are tangible objects designed to accomplish a particular task in households, common public buildings or offices. In order to accomplish this task, the device performs one or more functions. For example, a washing machine is designed to wash (task) and to accomplish this task it performs the start and stop function. The SAREF ontology offers a lists of basic functions that can be eventually combined in order to have more complex functions in a single device. For example, a switch offers an actuating function of type switching on/off . Each function has some associated commands, which can also be picked up as building blocks from a list. For example, the switching on/off is associated with the commands switch on , switch off and toggle . Depending on the function(s) it accomplishes, a device can be found in some corresponding states that are also listed as building blocks. When connected to a network, a device offers a service, which is a representation of a function to a network that makes the function discoverable, registerable and remotely controllable by other devices in the network. A service can represent one or more functions. A service is offered by a device that wants (a certain set of) its function(s) to be discoverable, registerable, remotely controllable by other devices in the network. A service must specify the device that is offering the service and the function(s) to be represented. A device in the SAREF ontology is also characterized by a profile that can be used to optimize some property, such as Energy, in a home or office that are part of a building.Information about changes compared to version 2.1.1: Small version bump to ensure that the turtle-version and the owl-version are up to date. Information about changes compared to version 1.1.1: (1)The classes and properties related to how to represent devices in building spaces (such as the saref:BuildingSpace class, saref:BuildingObject class and saref:isLocatedIn property) have been removed from SAREF and incorporated into the SAREF4BLDG extension related to buildings (https://w3id.org/def/saref4bldg), including the reuse of the W3CÂ® WGS84 geo positioning vocabulary; (2)The saref:DeviceCategory and saref:FunctionCategory classes have been removed.

It includes both orthogonal concepts (space, time, Earth realms, physical quantities, etc.) and integrative science knowledge concepts (phenomena, events, etc.). The ontology is modularized into 224 component files in this version, each representing a different namespace, with numerous dependencies implemented by OWL imports between the namespace. Component factoring may change in future versions.The original version was developed by Robert Raskin at JPL (see Raskin and Pan, 2005: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2004.12.004).

"SemWeb Vocab Status ontology","http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/ns","An RDF vocabulary for relating SW vocabulary terms to their status.This vocabulary was created in the FOAF project, based on experience with FOAF, Dublin Core and other early RDF vocabularies. Deployment experience shows that changing namespace URIs is expensive and unrewarding, so this vocabulary provides terms to support in-place evolution of structured data vocabularies. By indicating status at the level of terms rather than vocabularies, dictionary-style, fine grained improvements become easier. Different organizations and parties can agree or disagree on the status of a vocabulary term; however the status published alongside the term may deserve special attention. Future work could include patterns for citing announcements and decisions, or using SKOS to decentralise the extension of the basic status levels.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/vs/versions/2011-12-12.n3","","","","2011-12-12","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

De hecho, en el lenguaje SPEM no se dispone de mecanismos para detallar la estructura de los productos de trabajo, permitiendo sólo distinguir si se trata de un artefacto (Artifact), un entregable (Deliverable) o un resultado (Outcome) del proyecto.Los productos de trabajo típicos en los procesos software suelen ser principalmente documentos o código fuente y suelen gestionarse desde herramientas especializadas o genéricas. Por ejemplo, las herramientas de modelado software, como Rational Rose, o los sistemas de control de versiones, como Git, son ejemplos de herramientas especializadas que ofrecen soporte a la gestión de ciertos tipos de productos de trabajo. Sin embargo, otras herramientas genéricas como los sistemas de gestión de contenidos, los sistemas de gestión documental o los sistemas de edición colaborativa o wiki también pueden utilizarse para albergar evidencias de los procesos.El diseño de modelos para ciertos tipos de productos de trabajo ha sido una aproximación utilizada en diversas metodologías web dirigidas por modelos. Sin embargo, es habitual la necesidad de adaptar y personalizar metodologías conocidas para su aplicación en organizaciones específicas y para situaciones concretas, lo que se conoce como process tailoring. Por ello, se propone un vocabulario que permita definir productos de trabajo flexibles en cuanto a la estructura y tipo de sus artefactos.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/swpm/versions/2013-12-15.n3","","","","2013-12-19","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

In SCO, we are building a world-view inspired by the upper level Ontology SemanticScience Integrated Ontology (SIO) to model the descriptive statistics of characteristics on a set of patients (patient group) administered a medical intervention, and studied for an outcome in a research study. Since we capture the various definitions of patient groups (ie. by interventional measures or by control mechanisms), we provide the basic framework for filtering searches and to define cohort similarity at different granularities. ( cohort level and the study group levels ). For researchers who wish to contribute to the expansion of our ontology, we advise that they refer to our ontology documentation to familiarize themselves with the structure and term annotations ( such as definitions and labels).","Shruthi Chari","Deborah L.

"TaxonConcept Ontology","http://lod.taxonconcept.org/ontology/txn.owl","Version 0.976 This is an ontology for dealing with data related to species including observations, specimens, images etc. Traditionally species have been identified by the combination of a genus and specific epithet, for example Puma concolor. However these names change frequently as new information moves a given species into a different genus etc. Most of the time the species concept itself is unchanged. This leads a lot of confusion and difficulty connecting data relating to a given species concept together. This ontology and the related TaxonConcept data set avoids this by minting identifiers that are tied to a specific species concept which can have several names and classifications. The RDF descriptions of each species concept provides some guide as to what is the best species concept for a given specimen or observation, and links together data sets containing additional information about that concept. Since some of these related data sets entail specific names or classifications they are loosely linked using skos:closeMatch etc. Depending on your particular needs, you might want to merge these in your own knowledge base as sameAs or simply merge those properties that you think are appropriate.Version 0.976 Added additional GenusNameID, SubfamilyNameID and FamilyNameID for NLP project","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/txn/versions/2013-05-20.n3","","","","2013-05-19","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"TempO - Temporal Ontology","http://purl.org/tempo","In a typical (uni)temporal data model every resource s appearance (and disappearance) is being tracked.Numerous systems accomplish unitemporal tracking, either externally by e.g. using git to record the insertion or deletion of a resource, or internally by e.g. using prov:generatedAtTime and prov:invalidatedAtTime.This axis of time is known as *system time*, and none of TempO s concern because for one there is readily available support, and moreover because unitemporal tracking is used for principally true statements, i.e. those that have always been (considered) true or will always be (considered) true.TempO addresses bitemporal and tritemporal setups: Resources which are (known or believed to be) valid and efficacious for some time.A second time axis orthogonal to system time is introduced, that is a resource can be valid even though it is currently not in the system, or, conversely, can be already or still invalid by the time it enters the system.Efficacy, sometimes called decision time, is yet another concept orthogonal to validity, i.e. a resource that is no longer or not yet valid can be efficacious.The converse, a valid but inefficacious resource in the system, is *usually* not encountered but TempO does not impose restrictions on the shape of the time area.In general the necessity for tracking both validity and efficacy arises in areas where concepts are assigned a code or label that is subject to reuse following invalidation.Tracking efficacy and validity concurrently then allows for fine-grained control over how much future knowledge or how much past knowledge we tolerate in a datset.Example:--------Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918 but became part of Germany, Hungary and Poland in 1938.It was reestablished in 1945 but split into two sovereign states in 1993.The ISO 3166 country code for Czechoslovakia used to be CS , assigned in 1974, published in February 1978, and invalidated with the country s split.In 2003 ISO 3166 reassigned the country code CS to Serbia and Montenegro.The facts were assembled in 2018 and written down as follows: cc:CSHH a cc:ISO3166-CountryCode ; rdfs:label CS ; cc:refersTo Czechoslovakia ; prov:generatedAtTime 2018-02-29T04:00:00Z ^^xsd:dateTime . tempo:validFrom 1978-02 ^^xsd:gYearMonth ; tempo:validTill 1993-01-01 ^^xsd:date ; tempo:efficaciousFrom 1918 ^^xsd:gYear , 1945 ^^xsd:gYear ; tempo:efficaciousTill 1938 ^^xsd:gYear , 2003 ^^xsd:gYear .The use of the country code CS in a statement from 1988 can be resolved to cc:CSHH, as of today, free from ambiguity; it was valid back then after all and we know that today.The same query in 2017 (point-in-time query) would have yielded no results because the information hadn t been in the system back then.Point-in-time queries, however, are not TempO s major concern so only as-of-today queries are assumed from now on.Following the country s split it is highly likely that news reports from, say, 1994 highlighting the then-recent past would still have used CS to refer to cc:CSHH.According to the resource this is possible, a query for CS in 1994 would bring up cc:CSHH as it is efficacious but marked as invalidated.On the other end of history, the use of the code CS in, say, 1976 is plausible. The code was decided on but not yet formally published.A query for CS as used in 1976 would bring up cc:CSHH, marked as anachronistic.Going back further, a statement from, say 1942, using the code CS must clearly refer to something else.A query for CS as used in 1976 would yield not yield any results.--The ontology IRI http://purl.org/tempo/ always resolve to the latest version of TempO. Particular versionIRIs such as http://purl.org/tempo/0.1/ can be used by clients to force the import of a particular version.The goal of TempO is to allow for temporal constraints with control over how much future or past is permissible directly on the published resource, and as such, TempO does not restrict domain/ranges.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/tempo/versions/2022-08-20.n3","","","","2022-08-20","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"The Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) Lite Ontology","http://purl.org/iot/vocab/m3-lite#","M3-lite taxonomy is designed for the EU H2020 FIESTA-IoT project. It is a lite version of M3 ontology. M3-lite contains taxonomy for various QuantityKinds (commonly known as physical and environmental phenomena), Unit of measurements, different types of sensor and different types of domain of interests. M3-lite has evolved to serve the purpose of several testbeds that want to be part of federation provided by FIESTA-IoT. Most relevant testbeds integrated using M3-lite are EU FP7 s SmartSantander testbed, UniS s (UK) SmartICS testbed, Inria s (France) Soundcity/Ambiciti testbed, KETI s (South Korea) Mobius testbed and EGM s (France) 4G testbed. More information on the above testbeds along with those that have joined at the FIESTA-IoT platform is available via http://fiesta-iot.eu/index.php/fiesta-testbeds/. Intially, this taxonomy was a light weight version of M3 ontology and since 2016 has found its own separate way. We further acknowledge, testbed provider such as SmartSantander, UniS, KETI, Inria, and other open call testbeds for their valuable comments. Please report any errors to rachit.agarwal@inria.fr. The M3-lite is a taxonomy that enables testbeds to semantically annotate the IoT data produced by heterogeneous devices and store them in a federated datastore such as FIESTA-IoT.

Software engineers, architects (as Alexander who first introduced this term) and designers very often use – or rather reuse – patterns to handle problems which recur over and over. Patterns have also been studied to modularize and customize web ontologies (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org). They guarantee the flexibility and maintainability of concepts and solutions in several heterogeneous scenarios.We ve been investigating patterns for XML documents for some time. The overall goal of this research is to understand how the structure of digital documents can be segmented into atomic components, that can be manipulated independently and re-flowed in different contexts. Instead of defining a large number of complex and diversified structures, we have identified a small number of structures/patterns that are sufficient to express what most users need. Our idea is that a low number of patterns are enough to capture the most relevant document structures.An ontology defining formally patterns for segmenting a document into atomic components, in order to be manipulated independently and re-flowed in different contexts.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/pattern/versions/2013-07-16.n3","","","","2013-07-16","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"The RDF Presentation ontology","https://w3id.org/rdfp/","## RDF Presentation and RDF Presentation NegotiationAn RDF graph can be presented in several ways, using different media types. Examples of RDF media types include `application/rdf+xml`, `text/turtle`, `application/json+ld`.Today, most of the content consumed/produced/published, on the Web is not presented in RDF. In the Web of Things, HTTP servers and clients would rather exchange lightweight documents, potentially binary. Currently, most existing RDF Presentations generically apply to any RDF graph, at the cost of being heavy text-based documents.Yet, lightweight HTTP servers/clients could be better satisfied with consuming/producing/publishing lightweight documents, may its structure be application-specific.On the other hand, various formalisms have been developed:- to lift documents to RDF. Examples include [RML mappings](http://rml.io), [XSPARQL](http://xsparql.deri.org/), [SPARQL-Generate](http://w3id.org/sparql-generate/);- to lower RDF to documents. Examples include [XSPARQL](http://xsparql.deri.org/), [STTL, aka SPARQL-Template](https://ns.inria.fr/sparql-template/);- to validate RDF graphs. Examples include simple [SPIN](http://spinrdf.org/), [ShEx](http://shexspec.github.io), [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/). For a given range of RDF graphs and a specific media types, an RDF Presentation is a combination of lifting, lowering, and validation rules. With these rules, one can coherently interpret a representation as RDF (lift), validate the RDF graph, and generate back the representation from the RDF graph (lower).While sending any kind of document, potentially lightweight, an HTTP server/client may refer to the specific RDF Presentation that is used. Then, the HTTP client/server can lift the document to RDF, and validate it.Similarly, while requesting for an RDF graph, an HTTP server/client may inform the client/server what representation it prefers. Then, the client/server can validate the RDF graph, then lower it into a document.### RDF Presentation description Following the Linked Data principles, RDF Presentations are given uniform identifiers (URIs), and an RDF description of these presentations can be retrieved at their URI.The RDFP vocabulary can be used to describe RDF Presentations and the range of RDF graphs they apply to. It can be accessed at this URI: https://w3id.org/rdfp/ using content negotiation (i.e., set HTTP Header field `Accept` to one of the RDF syntaxes media types, or access it directly in [turtle](index.ttl), or in [RDF/XML](index.rdf).For example, the RDF Presentation identified by https://w3id.org/rdfp/example/graph/xml 303 redirects to https://w3id.org/rdfp/example/description where it is described as follows:```@prefix rdfp: .@base . a rdfp:Presentation ; rdfp:mediaType application/xml ; rdfp:liftingRule ; rdfp:loweringRule ; rdfs:isDefinedBy .```A full example RDF graph that uses this vocabulary can be found at URI https://w3id.org/rdfp/example/description. Use content negotiation, or access it directly in [turtle](https://w3id.org/rdfp/example/description.ttl), or in [RDF/XML](https://w3id.org/rdfp/example/description.rdf).The RDFP vocabulary describes web resources, RDF graphs, ontologies, and their representations. The URI of a named graph is the identification of that graph in the sense of the W3C Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One. The graph is the content, and that graph can be represented by many different documents that can then be exchanged on the Web.## Referring to an RDF PresentationThe RDF Presentation qualifies the representation type. Following the general architecture principles defined in [W3C Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/), we keep orthogonal the identification and representation concepts. Arguably, the representation type (the media type) should be annotated with a link to the RDF Presentation used. Although new media types could have a parameter that refers to its presentation, such as: `application/seas;p= https://w3id.org/rdfp/example/graph/xml `. This link cannot be set by a global media type parameter, as per [RFC 2045, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045):> There are NO globally-meaningful parameters that apply to all media types. Truly global mechanisms are best addressed, in the MIME model, by the definition of additional Content-* header fields.We hence introduce HTTP header field `Content-Presentation` for this purpose. The value of this field is any absolute URI, that identifies the RDF Presentation of the represented RDF graph. Using this header properly, any existing server can be adapted to behave as if it was producing RDF: the client simply needs to dereference the presentation link, and use the associated lifting rule to interpret the retrieved document as RDF.Equally important, a lightweight client/server can send lightweight binary messages, while still letting its server/client the chance to interpret the message body as RDF.## RDF Presentation NegotiationRDF Presentation Negotiation is a way for the client to state its presentation preferences for the response message body. To achieve this, we introduce HTTP header field `Accept-Presentation`. The value of this field is any (absolute) URI, that identifies the RDF Presentation the clients would like the server to use to encode the response RDF graph. Using this header properly, a lightweight client can request a compliant server to encode its responses in a specific format, hence transferring all the computation cost on the server.## Directly referring to the lowering rule, validation rule, or lifting ruleIn some situations, it may seem unreasonable to expect the client/server to:1. dereference the RDF Presentation URI,1. parse the RDF document,1. navigate to the lifting, validation, or lowering rule of the RDF Presentation.Hence, in a future version of RDFP, we may introduce additional HTTP header fields to directly refer to these rules. For example:- HTTP header field `Content-Lifting-Rule` would mean that the receiver may use this lifting to generate RDF from the content;- HTTP header field `Accept-Lowering-Rule` would mean that the client expects the server to use this lowering rule to generate a content it can process.## Implementation over Jersey[`rdfp-jersey-server`](get-started.html) is an extension of Jersey that eases the development of RESTful services that produce and consume RDF. It hides the RDF Presentation description and RDF Presentation Negotiation parts, and lets the end developer focus on manipulating RDF graphs as [Apache Jena](http://jena.apache.org/) models.## Related projectsThe RDFP vocabulary is used in the following related projects:- [ONTOP - Ontology Platform](https://w3id.org/ontop/);`rdfp-jersey-server` is used in the following related projects:- [PEP - Process Execution Platform](https://w3id.org/pep/);- [CNR Smart Charging Provider SEAS pilot platform](http://cnr-seas.cloudapp.net/scp/).## Contactmaxime.lefrancois.86@gmail.comhttp://maxime-lefrancois.info/","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/rdfp/versions/2016-08-31.n3","","","","2016-09-08","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

The alignment between SEAS and QUDT is expressed in [an external module](https://w3id.org/seas/QUDTAlignment) that imports the Evaluation ontology:- `qudt:Quantity` is a subclass of `seas:Property`;- `qudt:quantityValue` is a subproperty of `seas:evaluation`;- `qudt:QuantityValue` is a subclass of `seas:Evaluation`;- `qudt:numericValue` is a subproperty of `seas:evaluatedValue`.#### Using OMThe SEAS ontologies are compatible with the OM ontologies. The alignment between SEAS and OM has not yet been expressed in an external module. Please [get in contact with us](https://w3id.org/seas/team-list.html) if this is of interest to your project.#### Expressing values using custom datatypes We are working on a custom datatype identified by `cdt:ucum`. Thelexical value of a cdt:ucum is defined as follows :```unum ::= number ’ ’ unitnumber ::= noDecimalPtNumeral | decimalPtNumeral |scientificNotationNumeralunit ::= (see the Unified Code of Units of Measure specification)````noDecimalPtNumeral`, `decimalPtNumeral` and `scientificNotationNumeral` are definedin the XSD 1.1 recommendation. This datatype should either be hardcoded in RDF engines, or could be specified as a [Linked Datatype](https://w3id.org/lindt/), making it easy for any SPARQL engine to support the comparison of quantity values.For example, the following triples quantify the consumption of a fridge using `cdt:ucum` literals:``` seas:value 50.1 Hz ^^cdt:ucum . seas:value 231 V ^^cdt:ucum . seas:value 2432 mA ^^cdt:ucum . seas:value 1.68 RAD ^^cdt:ucum .```### Qualified evaluationsBecause property values may evolve in space and time, or because they can be approximate measures or forecasts, class [`seas:Evaluation`](https://w3id.org/seas/Evaluation) qualifies the link [`seas:value`](https://w3id.org/seas/value). In particular, an instance of seas:Evaluation may hold metadata about:1. the type of evaluation;2. the context of validity of the evaluation;3. provenance information or any other data.Let us shortly describe each of these categories.#### The type of evaluationThe type of evaluation is defined by the hierarchy of `seas:Evaluation` sub classes. This hierarchy includes classes such as:- [seas:TimeAverageEvaluation](https://w3id.org/seas/TimeAverageEvaluation): the given value is the average of the property value over its temporal context;- [seas:MaximumOperatingEvaluation](https://w3id.org/seas/MaximumOperatingEvaluation): the given value is the maximum operating value for the property in all of its validity context.#### The evaluation validity contextThe [W3C Spatial Data on the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/) may define a best practice for describing the validity context of some entity. See [Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices, W3C First Public Working Draft 19 January 2016](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/):> _Best Practice 11: How to describe properties that change over time_> [...]> When entities and their properties can change over time, or are valid only at a given time, and this needs to be captured, it is important to specify a clear relationship between property data and its versioning information. As soon as this is the case, we recommend to use the proposed best practice. In the meantime, an evaluation validity context is described using functional sub properties of [seas:hasValidityContext](https://w3id.org/seas/hasValidityContext). The SEAS ontologies define two such properties:- [seas:hasTemporalContext](https://w3id.org/seas/hasTemporalContext) links an entity to its temporal validity context, a [time:TemporalEntity](http://www.w3.org/2006/time#TemporalEntity);- [seas:hasSpatialContext](https://w3id.org/seas/hasSpatialContext) links an entity to its spatial validity context, a [geo:SpatialThing](http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing).#### Provenance or other metadataOther metadata may be added to describe an evaluation instance. For example the W3C [PROV Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) enables to describe the activity that generated the evaluation, or its generation time.Other vocabularies may be used to further describe evaluations. See the [Linked Open Vocabulary cloud](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/).#### ExamplesThe day-ahead forecasted temperature at Aeroport de Lyon is 28.3 °C:``` seas:evaluation [ a seas:Forecast ; prov:wasGeneratedBy ; prov:generatedAtTime 2016-08-12T12:00:00Z ^^xsd:dateTime ; seas:hasTemporalContext [ a time:Instant ; time:inXSDDateTime 2016-08-13T12:00:00Z ^^xsd:dateTime ] ; seas:hasSpatialContext [ a geo:Point ; geo:lat 45.7242502 ; geo:long 5.0914517 ] ; seas:evaluatedValue 28.3 °C ^^cdt:ucum ] .```The average frequency of property `` over time interval 12:00 - 13:00, as generated by ``, is 50.1054 Hz:``` seas:evaluation [ a seas:TimeAverageEvaluation ; prov:wasGeneratedBy ; seas:hasTemporalContext [ a time:Interval ; time:hasBeginning [ time:inXSDDateTime 2016-09-10T12:00:00Z ^^xsd:dateTime ] ; time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDDateTime 2016-09-10T13:00:00Z ^^xsd:dateTime ] ] ; seas:evaluatedValue 50.1054 Hz ^^cdt:ucum ] .```The minimal operating value of `` is 47.0 Hz:``` seas:evaluation [ a seas:MinimalOperatingValueEvaluation ; seas:evaluatedValue 47.0 Hz ^^cdt:ucum ;] .```","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/seas-eval/versions/2016-09-21.n3","","","","2016-09-21","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"The SEAS Feature of Interest ontology.","https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology","This ontology defines feature of interest and their properties, as an extension of the core classes of the SSN ontology (https://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/).A feature of interest is an abstraction of a real world phenomena (thing, person, event, etc). A feature of interest is then defined in terms of its properties, which are qualifiable, quantifiable, observable or operable qualities of the feature of interest. Figure below provides an overview of the concepts in this ontology:[![Overview of the System ontology](https://w3id.org/seas/featureofinterest.png)](https://w3id.org/seas/featureofinterest.png)For example the following RDF Graph describes a fridge, with its property ``:``` a seas:FeatureOfInterest ; seas:hasProperty .```One can further define the semantics of this property by refining the relationship it has with ``.This is done using sub properties of `seas:hasProperty`, informally named *property keys*, that are functional properties with domain `seas:FeatureOfInterest` and range `seas:Property`.For example, ```ex:consumption a owl:ObjectProperty , owl:FunctionalProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:hasProperty ; rdfs:domain ex:ElectricPowerSystem ; rdfs:range ex:EnergyProperty .```Then the link between `` and property `` can be further specified:``` a seas:FeatureOfInterest ; ex:consumption .```If a property is quantifiable, then it has one unique quantity dimension. There is hence a vocabulary of property classes depending on the quantity dimension they have.Unlike in the 2005 SSN ontology, any feature of interest property may itself be a feature of interest. In fact, the SSN ontology was originally based on the DUL ontology, which imposed that properties could not be feature of interest themselves. Yet we identified in some use cases where properties should have properties.For example, the fridge consumption has a frequency, or a faults counter. ``` a seas:FeatureOfInterest ; ex:frequency .```One may also define the class of electric power systems as the class of feature of interest that are linked to some property by property key `ex:consumption`:```ex:ElectricPowerSystem a owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf [ owl:onProperty ex:consumption ; owl:someValuesFrom seas:Property ] .```Alignments to other ontologies are proposed in external documents: - [SSNAlignment](https://w3id.org/seas/SSNAlignment) proposes an alignement to the [SSN ontology](http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/).- [QUDTAlignment](https://w3id.org/seas/QUDTAlignment) proposes an alignement to the [QUDT ontology](http://qudt.org/).Sub types of `seas:Property` constrain the type of the value of the property. This ontology defines only two such sub types of property, `seas:BooleanProperty` and `seas:EnumeratedProperty`. Other ontologies may define many more.There may be many other sub properties of `seas:hasProperty` define the semantics of the link between a feature of interest and its property. This ontology defines only one such subproperty of hasProperty: `seas:location`. Other ontologies may define many more.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/foio/versions/2016-07-01.n3","","","","2016-09-21","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"The Vagueness Ontology","http://www.essepuntato.it/2013/10/vagueness","Vagueness is a common human knowledge and language phenomenon, typically manifested by terms and concepts like High, Expert, Bad, Near etc.In an OWL ontology vagueness may appear in the definitions of classes, properties, datatypes and individuals. For these entities a more explicit description of the nature and characteristics of their vagueness/non-vagueness is required.Analyzing and describing the nature of vagueness/non-vagueness in ontological entities is subjective activity, since it is often a personal interpretation of someone (a person or, more generally, an agent).Vagueness can be described according to at least two complementary types referring to quantitative or qualitative connotations respectively. The quantitative aspect of vagueness concerns the (real or apparent) lack of precise boundaries defining an entity along one or more specific dimensions. The qualitative aspect of vagueness concerns the identification of such other discriminants of which boundaries are not quantifiable in any precise way.Either a vagueness description, that specifies always a type, or a non-vagueness description provides at least a justification (defined either as natural language text, an entity or a more complex logic formula, or any combination of them) that motivates a specific aspect of why an entity should be intended as vague/non-vague. Multiple justifications are possible for the same description.The justification of a description of vagueness having quantitative type can include an explicit definition of the dimensions (defined either as natural language text, an entity or a more complex logic formula, or any combination of them) in which the entity is vague.A description of vagueness/non-vagueness can also be context-dependent. In particular, the context-dependent objects are:- the descriptions of vagueness/non-vagueness related to entities (i.e. the same entity can be vague in one context and non-vague in another);- the dimensions related to a description of vagueness having quantitative type (i.e. the same entity can be vague in dimension A in one context and in dimension B in another). Note that it is the relation between a justification and a certain dimension that may specify a particular context, rather than the dimension itself.The annotation of an entity with information about its vagueness is a particular act of tagging done by someone (i.e., an agent) who associates a description of vagueness/non-vagueness (called the body of the annotation) to the entity in consideration (called the target of the annotation).The Vagueness Ontology (VO) allows one to specify vagueness characterisations of the TBox entities of an ontology.","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/vag/versions/2013-11-28.n3","","","","2013-11-28","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

An wfdesc:Artifact is associated with a wfdesc:Parameter using wfdesc:hasArtifact.

"VIR - Visual Representation ontology","http://w3id.org/vir#","This ontology, called VIR, is an extension of CIDOC-CRM created to sustain propositions on the nature of visual elements and permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.With the term visual element, we refer to those signs identified in the visual space as distinct and documentable units, and subject to an analytical interpretation.The scope of this ontology is to s to provide a framework to support the identification, annotation and interconnections between diverse visual elements and presents and assist their documentation and retrieval. Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.VIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective. Visual objects can be, in fact, polysemic and ambiguous, and it is not so easy to pin down a denotative or connotative meaning because they are very much context-dependent.On 03/03/2019 change the range of K11 to E36_Visual_Item in order to accomodate the description of the recognition of Attributes","","","This work is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/vir/versions/2019-02-26.n3","","","","2019-02-26","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

YSO has been founded on the basis of concepts in Finnish cultural sphere. As an indexing tool it is best applicable when indexed material is interdiscliplinary and its themes vary to a great extent.YSO s hierarchical construction is founded on parent-child relationships. In addition to this, some concepts are supplemented with associative and part-whole relations.Each concept in YSO is issued to at least one thematic group and some concepts have also been grouped with a non-hierarchical collection label (such as clothes by materials ).Following the international standards for thesauri, the terms for concepts are usually plural nouns. Terms in singular are usually mass nouns or terms referring to actions or abstract concepts. Some terms carry a different meaning when used in plural and in singular. For example, ballet refers to an art form and ballets to individual works of art.Place names are contained in a separate ontology, YSO places.YSO is based on General Finnish Thesaurus (YSA) and General Finnish Thesaurus in Swedish (Allärs). Concepts in YSO and concepts in YSA and Allärs have been linked to each other with equivalence relationships.

"\'Configuration as Linked Data\' ontology","http://purl.org/configurationontology","Ontology for the description of customizable products. It models the configuration process as the traversal of a graph of partially defined products, or Configurations .Ranges of customizable products are described rather effectively, for human users, by means of dedicated web applications called configurators. A configurator helps a user interactively define a product step by step, each step typically describing a valid partially defined product (or Configuration ), with a start price and a list of remaining choices given all previous selections.

Now identify each configuration with a URI returning the list of the configurations it is linked to, among other relevant information: what you have is a description of the range as Linked Data.The main classes of this ontology are Configuration (a state of the configuration process), Specification (a possible value of a characteristic of the configured product) and ConfigurationLink (which models a change of the state of the configuration process).","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/cold/versions/2013-11-21.n3","","","","2013-11-21","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"eProcurement Ontology - core","http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology","This module provides the definitions for the eProcurement ontology core. Procurement data has been identified as data with a high-reuse potential. Given the increasing importance of data standards for eProcurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector, the industry and academia have been kick-started in recent years. Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work. The vocabularies and the semantics that they are introducing, the phases of public procurement that they are covering, and the technologies that they are using all differ. These differences hamper data interoperability and thus its reuse by them or by the wider public. This creates the need for a common data standard for publishing procurement data, hence allowing data from different sources to be easily accessed and linked, and consequently reused.

"euBusinessGraph ontology","http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#","The euBusinessGraph (`ebg:`) ontology represents companies, type/status/economic classification, addresses, identifiers, company officers (e.g., directors and CEOs), and dataset offerings.It uses `schema:domainIncludes/rangeIncludes` (which are polymorphic) to describe which properties are applicable to a class, rather than `rdfs:domain/range` (which are monomorphic) to prescribe what classes must be applied to each node using a property.We find that this enables more flexible reuse and combination of different ontologies.We reuse the following ontologies and nomenclatures, and extend them where appropriate with classes and properties:- W3C Org, W3C RegOrg (basic company data), - W3C Time (officer membership), - W3C Locn (addresses),- schema.org (domain/rangeIncludes and various properties)- DBpedia ontology (jurisdiction)- NGEO and Spatial (NUTS administrative divisions)- ADMS (identifiers), - FOAF, SIOC (blog posts),- RAMON, SKOS (NACE economic classifications and various nomenclatures),- VOID (dataset descriptions).This is only a reference. See more detail in the [EBG Semantic Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhMOTlIOC6dOK_jksJRX0CB-GIRoiYY6fWtCnZArUhU/edit) google document, which includes an informative description of classes and properties, gives examples and data provider rules, and provides more schema and instance diagrams.## OverviewThe figure below gives an overview of the ontology, depicting the main classes and their relationships (i.e., object properties). The ontology covers the following areas:- Registered Organization: To represent a legal company.- Identifier System: To represent Identifier Systems. A company can have several Identifiers belonging to different Identifier Systems.- Officer: To represent associated company officers, e.g., directors.- Dataset: To represent information about datasets that are offered by company data providers.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-overview.png)### Registered Organization (company)Registered organizations are the main entities for which information is captured in the euBusinessGraph ontology. The ontology is not concerned with unregistered informal groups. Registered organizations gain legal entity status by the act of registration and are distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in some jurisdictions, sole traders. The figure below shows the classes and properties for representing core data about a registered organization.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-company-classes.png)### Identifier SystemMechanisms to identify companies in various data sources are essential in integration of data about companies across data sources. A proper understanding of what kind of systems of identifiers can be used for companies is thus necessary in this context. We analyzed various types of identifiers commonly used for companies and collected various properties of the systems they are part of. We modelled identifiers and identifier systems explicitly in the ontology as shown in thew figure below.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-identifier-classes.png)### OfficerWe use the membership model of the W3C Organization Ontology in a straightforward way to represent officer data as shown in the figure below.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-officer-classes.png)### Dataset DescriptionsData consumers need to know how many companies are included in a data provider dataset, from which jurisdictions, and what depth of data is included (e.g., which properties, addresses with what geo resolution, etc.). We thus need to express both metadata about the dataset itself, and fine-grained statistics about the content of a dataset, as shown in the figure below.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-dataset-classes.png)","","","","","","","https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/ebg/versions/2020-02-11.n3","","","","2020-02-11","Linked Open Vocabularies","https://lov.linkeddata.es/lov.n3.gz"

"gUFO: A Lightweight Implementation of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)","http://purl.org/nemo/gufo#","The objective of gUFO is to provide a lightweight implementation of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) [1-5] suitable for Semantic Web OWL 2 DL applications. Intended users are those implementing UFO-based lightweight ontologies that reuse gUFO by specializing and instantiating its elements.There are three implications of the use of the term lightweight. First of all, we have employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1, 2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation. The g in gUFO stands for gentle. At the same time, gufo is the Italian word for owl .For background information on the reference ontology on which this implementation is based, see: 1. G. Guizzardi, G. Wagner, J. P. A. Almeida, R.

Includes representations of common concepts learned by children at an early age, plus the most frequently used words of English.. Has representations of more than 12,000 of the most frequently occurring words in text corpora, with references to WordNet and OpenCYC categories having (approximately) the same meaning. As of Rev1743: 23647 owl:Classes TBD: 22,198 distinct Single-word WordNet labels 23,961 Single-word labels including also en and ldoce labels not in WordNet 18,642 distinct WordNet synsets linked (some appear more than once) *** Current phase of development ***: Current phase is to add in 4556 Words in the BYU 20,000 most frequent not already in the COSMO: Finished adding in 519 words from the most common 10,000 words in the BYU most-frequent list not already in COSMO: rev 1727 20200915 Finished adding in 438 words from the most common 8000 words in the BYU most-frequent list not already in COSMO: rev 1707 20200718 Finished adding in 1720 words from an American Sign Language on-line dictionary not already among the wordnet . or en tags, nor in the openCYC nor BNC lists. rev 1689 20200409 Finished adding in representations of about 1400 common words in OpenCYC not already represented in earlier versions at rev1623. Finished adding in representations of the 6300 most frequent words in the BNC corpus at rev 1577. Brief history: Effort at finding the full set of semantic primitives started with representation of the defining vocabulary of 2130 words in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. (LDOCE). The Longman-LDOCE vocabulary words and their WordNet mappings were completed to end of Z words (mapping completed) At rev1093. Started adding WN labels to entries that have ID s the same as common words, but which were not labeled (1600 of them at rev 1139) 20160423. Finished Z words. Added additional 900 words in the vocabulary of a 6-year old (from 1903) at rev 1283 20171209 Has 19 top-level classes under Thing The representation of English words was expanded by adding in words from the 5000 most frequent words in the BYU corpus, and words from the 6300 most frequent word in the BNC corpus (that were not in the BYU list). Finished at rev1577 20190729.

Added ontology elements corresponding to common English words (among the 5000 most frequent in the BYU corpus). Continuing with addition of representations of other common English words from an American Sign Language dictionary.. Parts of COSMO were closely aligned with elements of other public ontologies such as OpenCyc, SUMO, and BFO,in order to ease the translation of COSMO ontologies to those other structures, but the conceptual structure of COSMO (hierarchy and relations) is too different from those other ontologies to allow simplistic automatic translation; it is anticipated that translation will be possible, but will require bridging axioms to convert the terms and syntax of COSMO to those of any other ontology, and vice-versa. The meanings of the COSMO elements must be interpreted only from the structure of the COSMO ontology and from the full COSMO documentation. **NOTE** According to the documentation of those other ontologies, they are **freely usable** by the public, though they remain copyrighted by their originators and appear to require only acknowledgment of their use (more detail below). No copyright restrictions are attached to materials added in the COSMO project, therefore the only copyright restrictions for use of this ontology are those placed by the developers of the OpenCyc, SUMO, and BFO on parts derived directly from those works. Those derived parts will include some of the labels, and parts of the documentation, but the hierarchy and relations are those **specifically created** for COSMO, regardless of whether documentation or names were adopted from other ontologies. If necessary, the . documentation text or names can be changed to avoid copyright issues. ****************** Source Materials **************************** ***** WordNet, OpenCYC, SUMO, Random House Webster ************** ******************************************************************* Relation of COSMO to other ontologies: The COSMO ontology has a structure and basic viewpoint that differs in some significant parts from that of the ontologies from which it has derived materials, and the main parts of the hierarchical structure and relations are not primarily derived from any of the referenced ontologies, though some of the hierarchy is included because of its use in WordNet. Most basically, the representations were intended to adhere as closely as possible to **linguistic intuitions** about the meaning and usage of English terms, while specifying the meanings in a logically precise manner. Every element added to COSMO is individually evaluated for its utility and validity within the conceptual structure of the COSMO ontology, and is not derived or adopted solely or mainly on the basis of the appearance of a similar concept in another ontology. Certain individual subtype relations are similar to those in OpenCyc or SUMO; but because the basic hierarchical structure of COSMO differs from the other ontologies, logical inference using these relations will arrive at conclusions that cannot be aligned directly with either OpenCyc or SUMO. No simplistic mapping between COSMO and these other ontologies is likely to enable accurate inference. The documentation derived from OpenCyc and SUMO is provided as a means to **reference** similar concepts in those other ontologies, and to explain similarities and differences, for the convenience of those who are familiar with those ontologies. A few of the entres were included solely because of their presence in OpenCYC, but these are usually specific to CYC and are icluded solely to permit alignment with CYC concepts for those who are using the full CYC ontology. These are not essential to the structure of the ontology and could be removed. Contents derived from OpenCyc and SUMO are copyrighted and made freely available for public use under the terms found in the documentation for those works (see below).

There are no object properties or logical axioms that use the object properties in bfo_classes_only.owl. As the logical axioms in the bfo_classes_only.owl variant are limited to subclass and disjoint assertions they are much weaker than the logical axioms in bfo.owl. If you plan to use the relations that define BFO 2, you should import bfo.owl instead of bfo_classes_only.owl. To the extent that the relations are used without importing bfo.owl, be mindful that they should be used in a manner consistent with their use in bfo.owl. Otherwise if your ontology is imported by a another ontology that imports bfo.owl there may be inconsistencies. See the BFO 2 release notes for further information about BFO 2. Please note that the current release of bfo.owl uses temporal relations when the subject or object is a continuant, a major change from BFO 1. This is an early version of BFO version 2 and has not yet been extensively reviewed by the project team members.

"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mod.owl","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mod.owl","Annotation note 01 - [PSI-MOD:ref] has been replaced by PubMed:18688235. Annotation note 02 - When an entry in the RESID Database is annotated with different sources because the same modification can arise from different encoded amino acids, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different source instance carries the RESID cross-reference followed by a hash symbol # and a 3 or 4 character label. When an entry in the RESID Database is annotated as a general modification with the same enzymatic activity producing different chemical structures depending on natural variation in the nonproteinaceous substrate, on secondary modifications that do not change the nature of the primary modification, or on a combination of a primary and one or more secondary modifications on the same residue, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different instance carries the RESID cross-reference followed by the special tag #var . Annotation note 03 - When an entry in the Unimod database is annotated as a general modification, and one or more instance sites are listed, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different site instance carries the Unimod cross-reference followed by a hash symbol and an amino acid code, N-term or C-term . Annotation note 04 - The elemental formulas are in strict alphabetical order, not in CAS ( C and H first) order. Isotope numbers are in parentheses before the element symbol, and an element should not occur in a formula both with and without an isotope number. In difference formulas, counts can be zero or negative. Annotation note 05 - In entries with an isotope indicator in the formula, average masses are meaningless and are assigned the value equal to the monoisotopic mass, but rounded to a lower precision; monoisotopic masses are calculated by using the masses for the indicated isotopes and the most common isotopes for other elements without isotope indicators in the formulas. Annotation note 06 - For cross-link modifications, the number following Cross-link in the comment record indicates the number of amino acid residues that appear in the origin record, used to check the difference formula and masses. This usage differs from RESID, where the cross-link number indicates the maximum number of peptide chains that can be cross-linked. Annotation note 07 - The synonym cross-reference MOD:old name has been replaced by MOD:alternate name . Annotation note 08 - The DeltaMass listings for free amino acids have been removed. Most Unimod entries that have not been approved have by general agreement not been incorporated unless there has been a request for a specific term by a PRIDE submitter. Annotation note 09 - The Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm, OMSSA, enumerated list of modifications are being incorporated. The string values are synonyms with the synonymtypedef OMSSA-label , and their integer values (which are supposed to be stable) are definition cross-references. Annotation note 10 - GNOme is the Glycan Naming and Subsumption Ontology (https://gnome.glyomics.org/), an ontology for the support of glycomics. PSI-MOD does not have all possible glycans in its entries, just the ones that are noted to be on proteins and have been requested for addition. GNOme uses GlyTouCan (http://glytoucan.org/) to provide stable accessions for glycans described at varyious degrees of characterization, including compositions (no linkage) and topologies (no carbon bond positions or anomeric configurations).

"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ohd.owl","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ohd.owl","Status of this document: This is a work in progress and we do not yet make any promises about the stability of URIs. A known issue is that the upper level of this ontology is an exploratory version of BFO developed in the interim between when BFO 1 was current and before BFO 2 development started. The representation of the CDT codes is tentative - we are discussing this with the ADA. The integration between OBI and OGMS is not complete - we add some axioms here in order to use both in a consistent way. The version of the subject of the FMA used here is an automatic translation of a portion of the entities and relations present in the original FMA. Work is ongoing on improving this subset and using an up-to-date version of the FMA as its basis. The Oral Health and Disease Ontology is an ontology built to be compatible with the OBO Foundry ontologies, and is a collaboration between researchers at the University at Buffalo School of Dental Medicine, the University of Pittsburg School of Dental Medicine, and the Oregon Health and Science University.This ontology is licensed under the CC-BY License.

"http://purl.org/xtypes/","http://purl.org/xtypes/","This namespace provides identifiers for many common formats and encodings, and also for documents in that format and for (RDF) literals containing fragments of these formats. The Format-XXX and Encoding-XXX classes are intended for use with dcterms:format or similar predicates.The Document-XXX and DocumentEncoded-XXX classes are intended for use with rdf:type to indicate the format and character encoding of the Document available at a URL.The Fragment-XXX classes are intended for use as the datatype of literals in RDF. In some cases you might use Fragment-XXX as the type of a URL to indicate the URL resolves to a fragment, not a valid document. You might also use Document-XXX as a datatype if you had an entire valid document in a literal for some whacky reason.Sub-versions of formats, document types and fragments: If you want to specifically indicate a version of a document, fragment or format, you can refer to it in the form Fragment-HTML-4.1 - this will resolve to an RDF class telling you it s version 4.1 of Fragment-HTML.If you resolve Fragment-MyCrazyFormat that will resolve to a fragment class, and a format class. Use at your own risk. Motivation: This was actually just created due to the lack of a good datatype to indicate that a literal is a fragment of HTML rather than plain text. We brainstromed a list of useful formats and got the encodings from wikipedia, feedback welcome. blessing new formats or encodings: If there s a format or encoding which really should be in the main list, and not unstable tell me why at cjg@ecs.soton.ac.ukThis Ontology is public domain in the hope it will be useful by Christopher Gutteridge, University of Southampton, 2012.","","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=http://purl.org/xtypes/","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fxtypes%2F&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fxtypes%2F&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fxtypes%2F&f=ttl","2020-07-17","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"

"time-indexed value in context","http://purl.org/spar/tvc","Sometimes, we need to describe scenarios in which someone (e.g., a person) has a value (e.g., a particular role) during a particular time and for a particular context. Four different things are involved in these kinds of scenarios:1. the entity having some value, e.g. a person or a document possessing a role or a status;2. the value had by someone, e.g. a role or a status;3. the time period during which the entity has that value, e.g. from April 2008 to September 2008;4. the particular context that characterises the act of having that value, e.g. being a member of an institution or an editor of a particular journal.Thought as natural extension of the Time-indexed Situation pattern (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:TimeIndexedSituation), this ontological pattern, called Time-indexed Value in Context (TVC), is able to describe these kinds of scenarios.A pattern for the description of scenarios that involve entities having some value during a particular time and within a particular context.","","","","","https://archivo.dbpedia.org//info?o=http://purl.org/spar/tvc","","","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fspar%2Ftvc&f=nt","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fspar%2Ftvc&f=owl","http://archivo.dbpedia.org/download?o=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fspar%2Ftvc&f=ttl","2021-02-01","DBpedia Archivo","https://archivo.dbpedia.org/list"
